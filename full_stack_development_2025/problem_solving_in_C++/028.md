## 28. Write a function that takes two numbers and prints the largest one.Example:Input:number1 = 10;, Number2= 20; Output:20;


### **Approach 1: Brute Force (Using Simple `if` Conditions)**
The simplest way to determine the largest number between two numbers is to use a basic `if`-`else` condition. We will compare the two numbers and print the larger one.

---

### **Code Implementation for Brute Force Approach:**
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

// Function to print the largest number
void printLargestNumber(int number1, int number2) {
    // Compare the two numbers and print the largest
    if (number1 > number2) {
        cout << "The largest number is: " << number1 << endl;
    } else {
        cout << "The largest number is: " << number2 << endl;
    }
}

int main() {
    int number1 = 10; // First input number
    int number2 = 20; // Second input number

    // Call the function to print the largest number
    printLargestNumber(number1, number2);

    return 0;
}
```

### **Explanation of Brute Force Approach:**
1. **`if`-`else` Condition**: We compare the two numbers (`number1` and `number2`). If `number1` is greater, we print `number1`, else we print `number2`.
2. **Simple Decision Making**: The logic is straightforward and works for any two integer inputs.

### **Time and Space Complexity:**
- **Time Complexity**: **O(1)**. The comparison between the two numbers and the printing operation is a constant-time operation.
- **Space Complexity**: **O(1)**. The space used is constant since we are only storing two numbers.

### **Approach 2: Using the Ternary Operator**
The ternary operator is a shorthand for the `if`-`else` statement. It can be used to make the code more concise.

---

### **Code Implementation for Ternary Operator Approach:**
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

// Function to print the largest number using ternary operator
void printLargestNumberTernary(int number1, int number2) {
    // Use the ternary operator to find and print the largest number
    cout << "The largest number is: " << (number1 > number2 ? number1 : number2) << endl;
}

int main() {
    int number1 = 10; // First input number
    int number2 = 20; // Second input number

    // Call the function to print the largest number
    printLargestNumberTernary(number1, number2);

    return 0;
}
```

### **Explanation of Ternary Operator Approach:**
1. **Ternary Operator**: The ternary operator is a shorthand for `if`-`else`. It checks if `number1 > number2`. If true, it returns `number1`; otherwise, it returns `number2`.
2. **Concise Syntax**: This approach reduces the number of lines of code, making it more compact but still readable.

### **Time and Space Complexity:**
- **Time Complexity**: **O(1)**. The ternary operator performs a single comparison and returns the result.
- **Space Complexity**: **O(1)**. This approach uses constant space.

### **Approach 3: Using the `max()` Function**
In C++, the standard library provides a `max()` function that can be used to determine the larger of two numbers. This is the most optimal and readable solution.

---

### **Code Implementation for `max()` Function Approach:**
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <algorithm> // Include to use the max function
using namespace std;

// Function to print the largest number using max function
void printLargestNumberMax(int number1, int number2) {
    // Use the max function to find and print the largest number
    cout << "The largest number is: " << max(number1, number2) << endl;
}

int main() {
    int number1 = 10; // First input number
    int number2 = 20; // Second input number

    // Call the function to print the largest number
    printLargestNumberMax(number1, number2);

    return 0;
}
```

### **Explanation of `max()` Function Approach:**
1. **`max()` Function**: The `max()` function in the `<algorithm>` header compares two values and returns the larger one. It internally uses conditional logic to return the largest of the two numbers.
2. **Built-in Solution**: This is the most elegant and efficient solution because it uses the built-in function optimized for this purpose.

### **Time and Space Complexity:**
- **Time Complexity**: **O(1)**. The `max()` function performs a single comparison and returns the result.
- **Space Complexity**: **O(1)**. Like the other approaches, this also uses constant space.

### **Summary of All Approaches:**

| Approach                    | Code Length | Time Complexity | Space Complexity | Advantages                      |
|-----------------------------|-------------|-----------------|------------------|----------------------------------|
| **Brute Force (if-else)**    | Moderate    | O(1)            | O(1)             | Simple and easy to understand.  |
| **Ternary Operator**         | Short       | O(1)            | O(1)             | Compact, but still clear.       |
| **`max()` Function**         | Short       | O(1)            | O(1)             | Best practice, most readable.   |

### **Conclusion:**
- The **optimal approach** is using the **`max()` function** as it is the most concise, readable, and efficient solution provided by the C++ standard library.
- The **ternary operator** is a good alternative if you prefer a shorthand approach but still want to keep the logic clear and simple.
- The **brute force approach** using `if-else` is also perfectly valid and works well for beginners who are still getting comfortable with conditional logic.

All approaches have **O(1)** time and space complexity, making them equally efficient. The choice of approach largely depends on your preference for readability and code style.
