## 35. Print an inverted right-angled triangle pattern with n rows.


### **Approach 1: Using Nested Loops (Simple Approach)**

In this approach, we will use nested loops:
1. The outer loop will run from `1` to `n` (representing the number of rows).
2. The inner loop will print stars (`*`). The number of stars printed in the i-th row will be `n-i+1` stars (starting from `n` and reducing by 1 each time).

#### **Code:**

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int n; // Declare the variable for number of rows
    cout << "Enter number of rows: ";
    cin >> n; // Input number of rows
    
    // Outer loop for each row
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        // Inner loop to print stars in each row
        for (int j = 0; j < n - i; j++) {
            cout << "*"; // Print star
        }
        cout << endl; // Move to the next line after each row
    }

    return 0;
}
```

### **Explanation:**

1. **Input:**
   - We take input for the number of rows `n`.
   
2. **Outer Loop (i = 0 to n - 1):**
   - This loop controls the number of rows. It runs from `i = 0` to `i = n - 1`. Each iteration corresponds to one row of the triangle.
   
3. **Inner Loop (j = 0 to n - i - 1):**
   - This loop controls the number of stars printed in each row. Initially, for the first row, it prints `n` stars. As the outer loop progresses, the number of stars decreases by 1 each time.
   
4. **`cout << "*"`:**
   - This prints a star (`*`) in the current row.

5. **`cout << endl;`:**
   - After printing all the stars for the current row, this prints a new line and moves to the next row.

---

### **Time and Space Complexity:**

#### **Time Complexity:**
- **O(n^2)**: 
  - The outer loop runs `n` times (from 0 to `n-1`).
  - The inner loop runs `n - i` times for each row, which on average is `n/2` times. Therefore, the total time complexity is the sum of the lengths of all rows: 
    \[
    n + (n-1) + (n-2) + ... + 1 = \frac{n(n+1)}{2} \approx O(n^2)
    \]

#### **Space Complexity:**
- **O(1)**: 
  - The space complexity is constant because we are not using any extra space that grows with the input. We are only using a few variables for iteration (`i` and `j`).

---

### **Approach 2: Using a Single Print Statement (Optimized)**

This approach directly calculates and prints the stars in each row without using an inner loop.

#### **Code:**

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int n; // Declare the variable for number of rows
    cout << "Enter number of rows: ";
    cin >> n; // Input number of rows
    
    // Outer loop for each row
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        // Directly print stars for each row
        cout << string(n - i, '*') << endl; // Create a string with (n - i) stars
    }

    return 0;
}
```

---

### **Explanation:**

1. **`cout << string(n - i, '*')`:**
   - This is a C++ standard library function that creates a string of a specified length (here `n - i`).
   - For each row, it creates a string with `n - i` stars (`*`), which is then printed in one go.

2. **Time Complexity:**
   - The string creation and printing happen in **O(n)** for each row, but this operation happens `n` times, leading to a total complexity of **O(n^2)**.

3. **Space Complexity:**
   - **O(n)**: The `string` function creates a temporary string for each row, which requires **O(n)** space in the worst case (for the first row).

---

### **Approach 3: Using Recursion (Recursive Approach)**

In this approach, we will solve the problem recursively by printing each row using a helper function.

#### **Code:**

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

// Recursive function to print stars in each row
void printStars(int n, int i) {
    if (i == n) return; // Base case: if all rows are printed, return

    // Print the stars for the current row
    for (int j = 0; j < n - i; j++) {
        cout << "*"; // Print star
    }

    cout << endl; // New line after printing stars

    // Recursive call for the next row
    printStars(n, i + 1);
}

int main() {
    int n;
    cout << "Enter number of rows: ";
    cin >> n; // Input number of rows

    // Initial call to the recursive function
    printStars(n, 0);

    return 0;
}
```

---

### **Explanation:**

1. **Recursive Function `printStars(n, i)`:**
   - This function prints the stars for a given row (`i`).
   - If `i == n`, it stops recursion (base case).
   - Otherwise, it prints `n - i` stars for the current row and makes a recursive call to print the next row (`i + 1`).

2. **Time Complexity:**
   - **O(n^2)**: The total number of operations is still proportional to the sum of the row lengths, resulting in a time complexity of **O(n^2)**.

3. **Space Complexity:**
   - **O(n)**: The recursive approach requires space for the call stack, which can go up to a depth of `n`. Each recursive call requires **O(1)** space, but the total space required is proportional to the depth of recursion, which is **O(n)**.

### **Summary of Approaches:**

| Approach                       | Code Simplicity      | Time Complexity | Space Complexity | Explanation |
|---------------------------------|----------------------|-----------------|------------------|-------------|
| **Approach 1: Using Nested Loops** | Simple               | O(n^2)          | O(1)             | Uses two loops, one for rows and one for printing stars in each row. |
| **Approach 2: Using Single Print** | Moderate (Optimized) | O(n^2)          | O(n)             | Uses a string constructor to directly print stars in each row. |
| **Approach 3: Using Recursion** | Complex              | O(n^2)          | O(n)             | Recursively prints each row with stars. |

### **Conclusion:**
- **Approach 1** is the simplest and most efficient in terms of space complexity.
- **Approach 2** is optimized by using `string()` to print stars, reducing the need for an inner loop.
- **Approach 3** uses recursion, which is more elegant but less efficient in terms of space complexity due to the call stack.

For most use cases, **Approach 1** is the recommended solution because it is simple, clear, and has minimal overhead.
