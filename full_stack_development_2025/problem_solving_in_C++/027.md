## 27. Write a program to extract the file extension from a given filename.Example: Input: "document.pdf", Output: "pdf".


### **Approach 1: Brute Force (Using String Manipulation)**
In this approach, we can manually check for the last period (`.`) in the filename and extract the substring that comes after it, which is the file extension.



### **Code Implementation for Brute Force Approach:**
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
using namespace std;

// Function to extract the file extension from the filename
string getFileExtensionBruteForce(string filename) {
    // Find the position of the last period (.)
    int pos = filename.rfind('.');
    
    // Check if a period is found and it's not at the beginning of the string
    if (pos != string::npos && pos != 0) {
        // Extract the substring after the last period
        return filename.substr(pos + 1);  // Extract the file extension
    }
    return "";  // Return empty string if no period is found
}

int main() {
    string filename = "document.pdf";  // Example filename

    // Output the extracted file extension
    cout << "File Extension (Brute Force): " << getFileExtensionBruteForce(filename) << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

### **Explanation of Brute Force Approach:**
1. **Find the Last Period (`rfind`)**: We use the `rfind()` function to find the last occurrence of the period (`.`) in the filename. This helps in cases where there might be multiple periods in the filename.
2. **Check for Valid Period**: We check if the period is found (i.e., `rfind` doesn't return `string::npos`) and if it's not the first character of the string.
3. **Extract Substring**: If a valid period is found, we extract the substring starting from the character after the period using `substr(pos + 1)`.

### **Time and Space Complexity:**
- **Time Complexity**: **O(n)**, where `n` is the length of the string. The `rfind()` function scans the string once to find the last period, and `substr()` also takes linear time to extract the substring.
- **Space Complexity**: **O(n)** for storing the substring (which is the file extension).

---

### **Approach 2: Easy Approach (Using `find_last_of` Method)**
In this approach, we use the `find_last_of()` method to find the last occurrence of a period (`.`) and extract the file extension in a more concise manner.

---

### **Code Implementation for Easy Approach:**
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
using namespace std;

// Function to extract the file extension using find_last_of
string getFileExtensionEasy(string filename) {
    // Find the position of the last period (.)
    size_t pos = filename.find_last_of('.');
    
    // Check if a period is found and it's not the first character of the string
    if (pos != string::npos && pos != 0) {
        // Extract and return the file extension
        return filename.substr(pos + 1);  // Substring after the period
    }
    return "";  // Return empty string if no period is found
}

int main() {
    string filename = "document.pdf";  // Example filename

    // Output the extracted file extension
    cout << "File Extension (Easy Approach): " << getFileExtensionEasy(filename) << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

### **Explanation of Easy Approach:**
1. **`find_last_of()`**: This function is similar to `rfind()`, but it searches for any of the characters in the string argument. We pass `'.'` to find the last occurrence of the period.
2. **Check and Extract**: After finding the position of the period, we extract the substring after it (i.e., the file extension).

### **Time and Space Complexity:**
- **Time Complexity**: **O(n)**, where `n` is the length of the string. Both `find_last_of()` and `substr()` take linear time.
- **Space Complexity**: **O(n)** due to the storage of the substring (file extension).

### **Approach 3: Optimal Approach (Edge Case Handling)**
This approach is similar to the easy approach but includes additional edge case handling, ensuring that the filename contains a valid extension (i.e., not an empty string or a string with no period).

---

### **Code Implementation for Optimal Approach:**
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
using namespace std;

// Function to extract the file extension with edge case handling
string getFileExtensionOptimal(string filename) {
    // Ensure the filename is not empty and contains at least one period
    if (filename.empty() || filename.find('.') == string::npos) {
        return "";  // Return empty if no period is found or filename is empty
    }

    // Find the position of the last period (.)
    size_t pos = filename.find_last_of('.');
    
    // Return the file extension after the last period
    return filename.substr(pos + 1);
}

int main() {
    string filename = "document.pdf";  // Example filename

    // Output the extracted file extension
    cout << "File Extension (Optimal Approach): " << getFileExtensionOptimal(filename) << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

### **Explanation of Optimal Approach:**
1. **Edge Case Handling**: We check if the filename is empty or does not contain a period. If either condition is true, we return an empty string to indicate that no extension is present.
2. **`find_last_of()`**: This is used to find the last occurrence of a period (`.`) in the filename.
3. **Return the Extension**: After finding the period, we extract the file extension using `substr(pos + 1)`.

### **Time and Space Complexity:**
- **Time Complexity**: **O(n)**, where `n` is the length of the string. The operations `find_last_of()` and `substr()` both take linear time.
- **Space Complexity**: **O(n)** due to the creation of the substring (file extension).

### **Summary of All Approaches:**

1. **Brute Force Approach**:
   - **Advantages**: Simple and easy to understand.
   - **Disadvantages**: We manually access the last period, which may be less efficient in some cases.
   - **Time Complexity**: **O(n)**.
   - **Space Complexity**: **O(n)**.

2. **Easy Approach**:
   - **Advantages**: More concise and cleaner code using `find_last_of()`.
   - **Disadvantages**: No significant drawbacks.
   - **Time Complexity**: **O(n)**.
   - **Space Complexity**: **O(n)**.

3. **Optimal Approach**:
   - **Advantages**: Handles edge cases like empty filenames and filenames without extensions, ensuring robustness.
   - **Disadvantages**: Slightly more checks, but nothing complex.
   - **Time Complexity**: **O(n)**.
   - **Space Complexity**: **O(n)**.

---

### **Conclusion:**
The **optimal approach** is the most efficient and robust method, especially when considering edge cases like empty filenames or filenames without extensions. It ensures that the program does not throw errors and gracefully handles such cases. All three approaches have **linear time complexity (O(n))** and **linear space complexity (O(n))**, but the optimal approach ensures greater reliability in real-world applications.
