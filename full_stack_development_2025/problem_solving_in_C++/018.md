## 18. Print all elements that are at even indexes in the array arr = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]. Output:[10,30,50]

### **Approach 1: Brute Force**

#### Code:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

void printEvenIndexBruteForce(int arr[], int size) {
    cout << "[";
    for (int i = 0; i < size; i++) { // Loop through all elements
        if (i % 2 == 0) {           // Check if the index is even
            cout << arr[i];         // Print the element at the even index
            if (i < size - 2) {     // Add a comma if not the last even element
                cout << ", ";
            }
        }
    }
    cout << "]" << endl;
}

int main() {
    int arr[] = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50};
    int size = sizeof(arr) / sizeof(arr[0]);
    printEvenIndexBruteForce(arr, size);
    return 0;
}
```

#### **Time Complexity**:
- **Time Complexity**: \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the size of the array.
  - The loop iterates through all elements of the array. Even though we are only checking elements at even indexes, the loop must still go through all the elements in the array to check if the index is even.
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(1)\)
  - We only use a constant amount of extra space (for the loop variables and the output format), so the space complexity is constant.

#### Explanation:
In this approach, we iterate through every element of the array and check if the index is even using the condition `i % 2 == 0`. If the index is even, we print the corresponding element. This approach works but does not optimize the traversal by skipping odd indexes.

---

### **Approach 2: Moderate (Skip Odd Indexes)**

#### Code:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

void printEvenIndexModerate(int arr[], int size) {
    cout << "[";
    for (int i = 0; i < size; i += 2) { // Increment by 2 to skip odd indexes
        cout << arr[i];                 // Print the element at even index
        if (i < size - 2) {             // Add a comma if not the last even element
            cout << ", ";
        }
    }
    cout << "]" << endl;
}

int main() {
    int arr[] = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50};
    int size = sizeof(arr) / sizeof(arr[0]);
    printEvenIndexModerate(arr, size);
    return 0;
}
```

#### **Time Complexity**:
- **Time Complexity**: \(O(n/2)\), which simplifies to \(O(n)\).
  - Since we are incrementing the index by `2`, we are skipping half of the elements. Thus, the loop will run for half of the array elements, but since constants are ignored in Big-O notation, the complexity remains \(O(n)\).
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(1)\)
  - We only use a constant amount of space for the loop counter and the output formatting, so the space complexity remains constant.

#### Explanation:
This approach optimizes the brute force method by incrementing the loop index by `2` to directly access the elements at even indexes, avoiding unnecessary checks. Itâ€™s more efficient than the brute force approach because it only traverses half of the array.

---

### **Approach 3: Recursive Solution**

#### Code:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

void printEvenIndexRecursive(int arr[], int size, int index = 0) {
    if (index >= size) { // Base case: Stop recursion when index is out of bounds
        return;
    }
    cout << arr[index];  // Print the element at the current even index
    if (index + 2 < size) { // Add a comma if not the last even element
        cout << ", ";
    }
    printEvenIndexRecursive(arr, size, index + 2); // Recursive call for next even index
}

int main() {
    int arr[] = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50};
    int size = sizeof(arr) / sizeof(arr[0]);
    cout << "[";
    printEvenIndexRecursive(arr, size);
    cout << "]" << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

#### **Time Complexity**:
- **Time Complexity**: \(O(n/2)\), which simplifies to \(O(n)\).
  - In this recursive solution, we process one element every two steps, so we make about \(n/2\) recursive calls. But the time complexity remains \(O(n)\) because constant factors are ignored in Big-O notation.
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(n/2)\), which simplifies to \(O(n)\).
  - The recursion stack will consume space proportional to the number of calls made. Since each recursive call processes an even index, there will be approximately \(n/2\) recursive calls, leading to a space complexity of \(O(n)\).

#### Explanation:
This approach uses recursion to print elements at even indexes. It calls itself for each even index, reducing the problem size in each recursive call by 2. This method is elegant but consumes additional space on the call stack, making it less optimal than the iterative approach.

### **Approach 4: Using Temporary Array**

#### Code:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

void printEvenIndexWithTempArray(int arr[], int size) {
    int temp[size];   // Temporary array
    int tempIndex = 0;

    for (int i = 0; i < size; i += 2) { // Loop through even indexes
        temp[tempIndex++] = arr[i];    // Store element at even index in temp
    }

    // Print the temporary array
    cout << "[";
    for (int i = 0; i < tempIndex; i++) {
        cout << temp[i];
        if (i < tempIndex - 1) { // Add a comma if not the last element
            cout << ", ";
        }
    }
    cout << "]" << endl;
}

int main() {
    int arr[] = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50};
    int size = sizeof(arr) / sizeof(arr[0]);
    printEvenIndexWithTempArray(arr, size);
    return 0;
}
```

#### **Time Complexity**:
- **Time Complexity**: \(O(n)\)
  - The first loop iterates through the array, and the second loop prints the elements in the temporary array. Both loops contribute to a linear time complexity, which is \(O(n)\).
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(n)\)
  - A temporary array is created to store the elements at even indexes, which requires \(O(n)\) space. Therefore, the space complexity is \(O(n)\).

#### Explanation:
In this approach, we store the elements at even indexes in a temporary array and then print the elements of the temporary array. While it works and is simple to implement, it uses additional space for the temporary array, making it less optimal than the other approaches that don't require extra space.

### **Summary of Time and Space Complexities:**

| **Approach**                     | **Time Complexity** | **Space Complexity** |
|----------------------------------|---------------------|----------------------|
| **Brute Force**                  | \(O(n)\)            | \(O(1)\)             |
| **Moderate (Skip Odd Indexes)**  | \(O(n)\)            | \(O(1)\)             |
| **Recursive Solution**           | \(O(n)\)            | \(O(n)\)             |
| **Using Temporary Array**        | \(O(n)\)            | \(O(n)\)             |

- **Brute Force**: Best for simplicity but inefficient in terms of traversal.
- **Moderate**: Optimized for time by skipping odd indexes, minimal space usage.
- **Recursive**: Elegant and functional but inefficient in space due to recursive calls.
- **Temporary Array**: Simple but uses extra space for the temporary array, less efficient than the other methods.

For beginners, **Approach 2 (Moderate)** is the most efficient and easiest to understand, while **Approach 1 (Brute Force)** is simpler but less optimal.
