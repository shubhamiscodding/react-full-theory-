### **1. Brute Force Approach (O(n^2) Time Complexity)**

```cpp
#include <iostream>  // Include the iostream library for input/output
using namespace std;  // Use the standard namespace to avoid prefixing std::

int firstRepeatingElement(int arr[], int n) {  
    // Function to find the first repeating element using brute force.
    // It takes an array arr[] and its size n as input.

    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {  
        // Outer loop that iterates through the array.
        // We check each element one by one.

        for (int j = i + 1; j < n; j++) {  
            // Inner loop that compares the current element (arr[i]) with all subsequent elements (arr[j]).
            // The loop starts from i+1 to avoid comparing the same element again.

            if (arr[i] == arr[j]) {  
                // If we find an element at arr[j] that is equal to arr[i], then it's a repeating element.
                // We return arr[i] as the first repeating element.

                return arr[i];  // Return the repeating element.
            }
        }
    }

    return -1;  // If no repeating element is found after checking all elements, return -1.
    // -1 indicates there is no repeating element in the array.
}

int main() {  
    int arr[] = {10, 5, 3, 4, 3, 5, 6};  // Define an array with elements.
    int n = sizeof(arr) / sizeof(arr[0]);  // Calculate the size of the array.

    // Call the firstRepeatingElement function and print the result.
    cout << "First repeating element: " << firstRepeatingElement(arr, n) << endl;  
    // Output: 5, since 5 is the first repeating element.

    return 0;  // Return 0 to indicate the program has run successfully.
}
```

### **Time Complexity**:  
- **O(n^2)**: The time complexity is quadratic because we have two nested loops:
  - The outer loop runs `n` times.
  - The inner loop runs up to `n-i-1` times for each `i` (in the worst case).
  
Thus, the total time complexity is the sum of all iterations of the inner loop: `n + (n-1) + (n-2) + ... + 1`, which is `O(n^2)`.

### **Space Complexity**:  
- **O(1)**: The space complexity is constant because we are only using a few variables for iteration and not any extra data structures (apart from the input array).

### **2. Optimized Approach Using Hash Set (O(n) Time Complexity)**

```cpp
#include <iostream>  // Include the iostream library for input/output
#include <unordered_set>  // Include unordered_set to store unique elements
using namespace std;  // Use the standard namespace to avoid prefixing std::

int firstRepeatingElement(int arr[], int n) {  
    // Function to find the first repeating element using an unordered set.
    // Takes the array arr[] and its size n as input.

    unordered_set<int> seen;  // Create an unordered set to store elements that we have already encountered.
    // unordered_set is efficient for O(1) lookups and insertions on average.

    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {  
        // Iterate through the array elements.

        if (seen.find(arr[i]) != seen.end()) {  
            // If the current element arr[i] is found in the set 'seen', it means we've already encountered it.
            // The find() method searches for arr[i] in the set and returns an iterator.
            // If it's found, it returns an iterator pointing to the element, otherwise, it returns 'end()'.

            return arr[i];  // Return the repeating element because it's the first one we encountered.
        }

        seen.insert(arr[i]);  // If not found in the set, add arr[i] to the set.
        // This means we've encountered this element for the first time.
    }

    return -1;  // If no repeating element is found, return -1.
    // -1 indicates that there is no repeating element in the array.
}

int main() {  
    int arr[] = {10, 5, 3, 4, 3, 5, 6};  // Define an array with elements.
    int n = sizeof(arr) / sizeof(arr[0]);  // Calculate the size of the array.

    // Call the firstRepeatingElement function and print the result.
    cout << "First repeating element: " << firstRepeatingElement(arr, n) << endl;  
    // Output: 5, since 5 is the first repeating element.

    return 0;  // Return 0 to indicate the program has run successfully.
}
```

### **Time Complexity**:  
- **O(n)**:  
  - Inserting and searching for elements in an `unordered_set` takes constant time **O(1)** on average.
  - We only loop through the array once, so the overall time complexity is linear.

### **Space Complexity**:  
- **O(n)**:  
  - The space complexity is linear because we use an unordered set to store up to `n` unique elements (in the worst case).

---

### **3. Optimized Approach Using Hash Map (O(n) Time Complexity)**

```cpp
#include <iostream>  // Include the iostream library for input/output
#include <unordered_map>  // Include unordered_map to store frequency of elements
using namespace std;  // Use the standard namespace to avoid prefixing std::

int firstRepeatingElement(int arr[], int n) {  
    // Function to find the first repeating element using a hash map.
    // Takes the array arr[] and its size n as input.

    unordered_map<int, int> freqMap;  // Create a hash map to store the frequency of each element.
    // unordered_map provides O(1) average time complexity for lookups and insertions.

    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {  
        // Iterate through the array.

        if (freqMap[arr[i]] > 0) {  
            // If the frequency of the element arr[i] is greater than 0, it means it's repeating.
            // The value of arr[i] is used as the key in the frequency map.

            return arr[i];  // Return the repeating element.
        }

        freqMap[arr[i]] = 1;  // If the element is not repeating, insert it into the map with a frequency of 1.
    }

    return -1;  // If no repeating element is found, return -1.
    // -1 indicates that there is no repeating element in the array.
}

int main() {  
    int arr[] = {10, 5, 3, 4, 3, 5, 6};  // Define an array with elements.
    int n = sizeof(arr) / sizeof(arr[0]);  // Calculate the size of the array.

    // Call the firstRepeatingElement function and print the result.
    cout << "First repeating element: " << firstRepeatingElement(arr, n) << endl;  
    // Output: 5, since 5 is the first repeating element.

    return 0;  // Return 0 to indicate the program has run successfully.
}
```

### **Time Complexity**:  
- **O(n)**:  
  - Inserting and checking elements in an unordered map takes **O(1)** time on average.
  - We only loop through the array once, so the overall time complexity is linear.

### **Space Complexity**:  
- **O(n)**:  
  - The space complexity is linear because the hash map stores the frequency of each unique element, and in the worst case, it can store all `n` elements.

---

### **4. Optimized Approach Using Negative Marking (O(n) Time Complexity)**

```cpp
#include <iostream>  // Include the iostream library for input/output
using namespace std;  // Use the standard namespace to avoid prefixing std::

int firstRepeatingElement(int arr[], int n) {  
    // Function to find the first repeating element using negative marking.
    // This approach works by modifying the input array itself to track visited elements.

    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {  
        // Loop through each element in the array.

        int element = abs(arr[i]);  
        // Get the absolute value of the current element arr[i].
        // The absolute value is used to ensure we are not affected by negative markings in the array.

        if (arr[element] < 0) {  
            // If the element at index 'element' is negative, it means we've encountered this element before.
            // This indicates the element is repeating.

            return element;  // Return the first repeating element.
        }

        arr[element] = -arr[element];  
        // Mark the element at index 'element' as visited by making it negative.
        // If the element at index 'element' is already negative, it means it's repeating.
    }

    return -1;  // If no repeating element is found, return -1.
    // -1 indicates there is no repeating element in the array.
}

int main() {  
    int arr

[] = {10, 5, 3, 4, 3, 5, 6};  // Define an array with elements.
    int n = sizeof(arr) / sizeof(arr[0]);  // Calculate the size of the array.

    // Call the firstRepeatingElement function and print the result.
    cout << "First repeating element: " << firstRepeatingElement(arr, n) << endl;  
    // Output: 5, since 5 is the first repeating element.

    return 0;  // Return 0 to indicate the program has run successfully.
}
```

### **Time Complexity**:  
- **O(n)**:  
  - The time complexity is linear because we loop through the array once and modify elements in place.

### **Space Complexity**:  
- **O(1)**:  
  - The space complexity is constant because we do not use any extra data structures for tracking visited elements. We modify the array in place.

### Conclusion:

- The **Brute Force** approach has **O(n^2)** time complexity and **O(1)** space complexity.
- The **Optimized Approaches** using **Hash Set**, **Hash Map**, and **Negative Marking** all have **O(n)** time complexity but differ in space complexity:
  - Hash Set and Hash Map require **O(n)** space.
  - Negative Marking requires **O(1)** space, but it modifies the input array.
