## 46. Given a string, return the index of the first repeating character. If no character repeats, return -1.
 Input: "hello"
Output: 2 (because 'l' repeats first)
Input: "abcdef"
Output: -1


### Approaches to Solve:

#### **Approach 1: Brute Force (Nested Loops)**
In this approach, we will check each character and compare it with every other character that comes after it. If we find a match, we return the index of the first repeating character. Otherwise, we return `-1` if no repetition is found.

##### **Code**:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
using namespace std;

// Brute force approach to find the first repeating character
int firstRepeatingCharacter(string str) {
    int n = str.length();
    
    // Outer loop: For each character in the string
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        // Inner loop: Compare the current character with the rest of the characters
        for (int j = i + 1; j < n; j++) {
            if (str[i] == str[j]) {
                return i;  // Return index of the first repeating character
            }
        }
    }
    
    return -1;  // No repeating character found
}

int main() {
    string input = "hello";
    cout << "First repeating character index: " << firstRepeatingCharacter(input) << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

##### **Explanation**:
1. **Outer loop (i)**: Iterates through each character.
2. **Inner loop (j)**: Compares the current character with all subsequent characters.
3. If a match is found, the index `i` is returned as the index of the first repeating character.
4. If no matches are found, return `-1`.

##### **Time Complexity**:  
- The outer loop runs `n` times, and the inner loop runs `n-1`, `n-2`, ... down to `1` times, resulting in \( O(n^2) \).

##### **Space Complexity**:  
- \( O(1) \), since no extra data structures are used.

---

#### **Approach 2: Using a Hash Map (Optimized)**  
This is a more efficient approach. We can use a hash map (or unordered map) to store the characters as we encounter them, and check if any character has already been seen. This allows us to reduce the time complexity to linear time.

##### **Code**:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <unordered_map>
using namespace std;

// Optimized approach to find the first repeating character
int firstRepeatingCharacter(string str) {
    unordered_map<char, int> seen;  // Hash map to store character count
    
    // Traverse the string
    for (int i = 0; i < str.length(); i++) {
        if (seen.find(str[i]) != seen.end()) {
            return i;  // Character found in the hash map, it's the first repeating one
        }
        seen[str[i]] = i;  // Store the character and its index
    }
    
    return -1;  // No repeating character found
}

int main() {
    string input = "hello";
    cout << "First repeating character index: " << firstRepeatingCharacter(input) << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

##### **Explanation**:
1. We use an `unordered_map` to track each character and the index where it appears in the string.
2. As we iterate through the string:
   - If a character is already present in the map, we return its index as the first repeating character.
   - If the character is not in the map, we add it with its index.
3. If no repetition is found, return `-1`.

##### **Time Complexity**:  
- \( O(n) \), because we traverse the string once, and the operations on the hash map (insertion and lookup) are \( O(1) \) on average.

##### **Space Complexity**:  
- \( O(n) \), because we store each character in the hash map.

---

#### **Approach 3: Using an Array (Fixed Set of Characters)**  
If the input string only consists of lowercase English letters ('a' to 'z'), we can optimize the solution even further by using a fixed-size array of size 26 (one for each letter). This reduces space complexity.

##### **Code**:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
using namespace std;

// Approach using an array to track character occurrence
int firstRepeatingCharacter(string str) {
    int seen[26] = {0};  // Array to store occurrences of each character (assuming lowercase letters only)
    
    // Traverse the string
    for (int i = 0; i < str.length(); i++) {
        int index = str[i] - 'a';  // Calculate the index of the character (0 for 'a', 1 for 'b', etc.)
        if (seen[index] > 0) {
            return i;  // Character repeats, return its index
        }
        seen[index] = 1;  // Mark this character as seen
    }
    
    return -1;  // No repeating character found
}

int main() {
    string input = "hello";
    cout << "First repeating character index: " << firstRepeatingCharacter(input) << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

##### **Explanation**:
1. We use a fixed-size array `seen` of size 26 to track the occurrence of characters.
2. For each character, we calculate its index in the array based on its ASCII value.
   - If a character is encountered more than once, we return the index of the first repeating character.
   - If a character is encountered for the first time, we mark it as seen.
3. If no repetition is found, return `-1`.

##### **Time Complexity**:  
- \( O(n) \), because we traverse the string once.

##### **Space Complexity**:  
- \( O(1) \), because the size of the array is fixed (size 26 for lowercase letters), and we don't use extra space that grows with input size.

### Comparison of All Approaches

| **Approach**                 | **Time Complexity** | **Space Complexity** |
|------------------------------|---------------------|----------------------|
| **Brute Force**               | \( O(n^2) \)        | \( O(1) \)           |
| **Using Hash Map**            | \( O(n) \)          | \( O(n) \)           |
| **Using Array (Fixed Set)**   | \( O(n) \)          | \( O(1) \)           |

---

### **Conclusion**:

- **For Beginners**: The **Brute Force** approach is easy to understand but inefficient for larger strings due to its \( O(n^2) \) time complexity. This method is a good starting point to understand the basic logic.
  
- **Optimized Approaches**: The **Hash Map** and **Array** approaches are much more efficient with a time complexity of \( O(n) \). The hash map approach is general and works for any string, while the array approach is more memory-efficient when you know the string only contains lowercase English letters.

- **Best Approach for Large Inputs**: If performance is important (i.e., for larger strings), the **Hash Map** or **Array** approach would be the best choices. If the string contains only lowercase English letters, the **Array Approach** is the most optimal due to its \( O(1) \) space complexity.
