## 36. Print a pyramid pattern with n rows.


### **Approach 1: Using Nested Loops**

We will use nested loops:
1. The outer loop controls the number of rows (`n`).
2. The inner loops handle the spaces and stars for each row.
   - The number of spaces for each row is `(n - i - 1)`, where `i` is the current row number.
   - The number of stars for each row is `(2 * i + 1)`.

### **Code:**

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int n;
    cout << "Enter number of rows: ";
    cin >> n;  // Input number of rows

    // Outer loop for each row
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        // Loop to print spaces
        for (int j = 0; j < n - i - 1; j++) {
            cout << " ";  // Print space
        }

        // Loop to print stars
        for (int j = 0; j < 2 * i + 1; j++) {
            cout << "*";  // Print star
        }

        cout << endl;  // Move to the next line after each row
    }

    return 0;
}
```

### **Explanation:**

1. **Input:**
   - We take input for `n`, which represents the number of rows in the pyramid.
   
2. **Outer Loop (i = 0 to n - 1):**
   - This loop iterates over each row. The first row starts with `i = 0` and the last row is `i = n - 1`.

3. **Inner Loop for Spaces (j = 0 to n - i - 1):**
   - For each row `i`, we print `(n - i - 1)` spaces. This ensures that the stars are centered.

4. **Inner Loop for Stars (j = 0 to 2 * i + 1):**
   - For each row `i`, we print `(2 * i + 1)` stars. This ensures that the number of stars increases by 2 as we move down the pyramid.

5. **`cout << endl;`:**
   - After printing spaces and stars for a row, we print a new line to move to the next row.

### **Time and Space Complexity:**

#### **Time Complexity:**
- **O(n^2):**
  - The outer loop runs `n` times.
  - For each iteration of the outer loop, we perform two inner loops:
    - The first inner loop runs `(n - i - 1)` times (spaces).
    - The second inner loop runs `(2 * i + 1)` times (stars).
  - Thus, the total time complexity is the sum of spaces and stars across all rows, which is approximately:
    \[
    (n-1) + (n-2) + ... + 1 + 1 + 3 + 5 + ... + (2n-1) \approx O(n^2)
    \]

#### **Space Complexity:**
- **O(1):**
  - We are not using any additional data structures that scale with the input size. The space complexity is constant, as we only use a few variables (`i`, `j`) for iteration.

---

### **Approach 2: Using a String to Build Each Row (Optimized)**

Instead of printing each star and space directly in the loop, we can build each row as a string and print it at once. This can sometimes reduce overhead in terms of multiple IO operations.

#### **Code:**

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int n;
    cout << "Enter number of rows: ";
    cin >> n;  // Input number of rows

    // Outer loop for each row
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        string row = "";  // Initialize an empty string for the row

        // Add spaces
        row += string(n - i - 1, ' ');  // Adds (n - i - 1) spaces

        // Add stars
        row += string(2 * i + 1, '*');  // Adds (2 * i + 1) stars

        cout << row << endl;  // Print the row
    }

    return 0;
}
```

---

### **Explanation:**

1. **String Manipulation:**
   - Instead of printing each character individually, we use the `string()` constructor to generate a string containing the required number of spaces and stars for each row.
   
2. **`row += string(n - i - 1, ' ');`:**
   - This creates a string with `(n - i - 1)` spaces and appends it to `row`.
   
3. **`row += string(2 * i + 1, '*');`:**
   - This creates a string with `(2 * i + 1)` stars and appends it to `row`.

4. **`cout << row << endl;`:**
   - The entire row (spaces + stars) is printed in one go.

---

### **Time and Space Complexity:**

#### **Time Complexity:**
- **O(n^2):**
  - Like the previous approach, the time complexity remains **O(n^2)**. The construction of the strings and printing each row still requires iterating through each row and performing string concatenation.
  
#### **Space Complexity:**
- **O(n):**
  - We use an additional string variable (`row`) to store each row before printing it. The maximum size of the string is `2 * n - 1`, so the space complexity is **O(n)**.

---

### **Approach 3: Using Recursion**

We can also solve the problem recursively. The function will print one row at a time and recursively move to the next row until all rows are printed.

#### **Code:**

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

// Recursive function to print pyramid pattern
void printPyramid(int n, int i) {
    if (i == n) return; // Base case: if i reaches n, stop recursion

    // Print spaces
    for (int j = 0; j < n - i - 1; j++) {
        cout << " ";
    }

    // Print stars
    for (int j = 0; j < 2 * i + 1; j++) {
        cout << "*";
    }

    cout << endl; // New line after printing stars

    // Recursive call for the next row
    printPyramid(n, i + 1);
}

int main() {
    int n;
    cout << "Enter number of rows: ";
    cin >> n;  // Input number of rows

    // Start the recursion with the first row (i = 0)
    printPyramid(n, 0);

    return 0;
}
```

---

### **Explanation:**

1. **Recursive Function `printPyramid(n, i)`:**
   - This function prints the stars for row `i`.
   - If `i == n`, the recursion stops (base case).
   - Otherwise, it prints the necessary number of spaces and stars for the current row, and then recursively calls itself with `i + 1` to print the next row.

2. **Time Complexity:**
   - **O(n^2)**: Similar to the iterative approaches, the time complexity is dominated by the number of spaces and stars printed across all rows.

3. **Space Complexity:**
   - **O(n)**: The recursive call stack adds space complexity, with the depth of recursion being `n`. Each recursive call adds constant space for local variables, resulting in **O(n)** space complexity.
