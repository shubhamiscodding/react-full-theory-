## 41. Given a valid IP address, you are asked to return a defanged version of that IP address. A defanged IP address replaces every period "." with "[.]".

### **1. Brute-Force Approach (Using String Traversal):**
- Traverse each character of the string.
- If the character is a period (`'.'`), append `"[.]"` to a new result string.
- Otherwise, append the character as it is.

#### Code:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
using namespace std;

string defangIP(string address) {
    string result = "";  // To store the defanged IP address

    // Traverse each character in the input address
    for (int i = 0; i < address.length(); i++) {
        if (address[i] == '.') {
            result += "[.]";  // Replace '.' with "[.]"
        } else {
            result += address[i];  // Add the character to the result
        }
    }

    return result;  // Return the defanged IP address
}

int main() {
    string address = "1.1.1.1";
    cout << "Defanged IP: " << defangIP(address) << endl;

    address = "255.100.50.0";
    cout << "Defanged IP: " << defangIP(address) << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Logic**:
   - A new string `result` is initialized.
   - Each character of the input string `address` is checked.
   - If the character is `'.'`, the string `"[.]"` is appended to `result`.
   - Otherwise, the character is directly appended to `result`.

2. **Example Walkthrough**:
   - Input: `"1.1.1.1"`
   - Processing:
     - `'1'`: Append to result → `"1"`
     - `'.'`: Append `"[.]"` → `"1[.]"`
     - `'1'`: Append → `"1[.]1"`
     - Repeat for the remaining characters.
   - Final Output: `"1[.]1[.]1[.]1"`

---

### Time and Space Complexity:

#### Time Complexity:
- **Traversal**: `O(n)` where `n` is the length of the input string. Each character is processed once.
- **Appending to String**: Each append operation takes constant time.

Total Time Complexity: **`O(n)`**

#### Space Complexity:
- **Result String**: Stores the defanged IP address. In the worst case, the size of `result` is approximately `3n` (if every character is a period).
  
Total Space Complexity: **`O(n)`**

---

### **2. Optimized Approach (In-Place Modification for Fixed Size):**
- This approach assumes we have a fixed-size array large enough to hold the result. We write directly to this array to avoid repeated string concatenation.

#### Code:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cstring>  // For strcpy
using namespace std;

void defangIPInPlace(const char* address, char* result) {
    int j = 0;  // Pointer for the result array

    // Traverse the input string
    for (int i = 0; address[i] != '\0'; i++) {
        if (address[i] == '.') {
            // Replace '.' with "[.]"
            result[j++] = '[';
            result[j++] = '.';
            result[j++] = ']';
        } else {
            result[j++] = address[i];  // Copy character as is
        }
    }

    result[j] = '\0';  // Null-terminate the result
}

int main() {
    const char* address = "1.1.1.1";
    char result[50];  // Allocate sufficient space for the result

    defangIPInPlace(address, result);
    cout << "Defanged IP: " << result << endl;

    address = "255.100.50.0";
    defangIPInPlace(address, result);
    cout << "Defanged IP: " << result << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

---

### Explanation:
1. **Logic**:
   - A result array `result` is pre-allocated with sufficient size to hold the defanged IP.
   - For each character:
     - If it's `'.'`, replace it with three characters: `'['`, `'.'`, and `']'`.
     - Otherwise, copy the character as is.
   - Null-terminate the `result` array at the end.

2. **Example Walkthrough**:
   - Input: `"1.1.1.1"`
   - Processing:
     - `'1'`: Write to result → `"1"`
     - `'.'`: Write `[.]` → `"1[.]"`
     - Repeat for the remaining characters.
   - Final Output: `"1[.]1[.]1[.]1"`

---

### Time and Space Complexity:

#### Time Complexity:
- **Traversal**: `O(n)` where `n` is the length of the input string.

#### Space Complexity:
- **In-Place Result**: The result array is pre-allocated, so the space complexity is constant relative to the input size.

Total Space Complexity: **`O(n)`**

---

### **3. Using Standard Library Functions (Replace Approach):**
- Use standard library functions to simplify the replacement of `'.'` with `"[.]"`.

#### Code:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
using namespace std;

string defangIPUsingReplace(string address) {
    size_t pos = 0;

    // Replace '.' with "[.]" using find and replace
    while ((pos = address.find('.', pos)) != string::npos) {
        address.replace(pos, 1, "[.]");
        pos += 3;  // Move past the replaced "[.]"
    }

    return address;
}

int main() {
    string address = "1.1.1.1";
    cout << "Defanged IP: " << defangIPUsingReplace(address) << endl;

    address = "255.100.50.0";
    cout << "Defanged IP: " << defangIPUsingReplace(address) << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

---

### Explanation:
1. **Logic**:
   - Use `string::find` to locate each occurrence of `'.'`.
   - Replace each occurrence of `'.'` with `"[.]"` using `string::replace`.

2. **Example Walkthrough**:
   - Input: `"1.1.1.1"`
   - Processing:
     - Find `'.'` at position 1, replace with `"[.]"`.
     - Repeat for the remaining positions.
   - Final Output: `"1[.]1[.]1[.]1"`

---

### Time and Space Complexity:

#### Time Complexity:
- **Traversal**: `O(n)` for locating and replacing each `'.'`.

#### Space Complexity:
- **String Replacement**: Creates a new string for the modified IP.

Total Space Complexity: **`O(n)`**

### Conclusion:

1. **Brute Force**: Simple and intuitive; best for beginners.  
2. **In-Place**: Efficient for fixed-size memory.  
3. **Replace Method**: Most concise but slightly more advanced due to standard library usage.
