## 55.You are given an integer n. Your task is to write a program that determines whether n is a power of three. If n is a power of three, return true; otherwise, return false.A number is a power of three if:n=3kn = 3^kn=3k
where k is a non-negative integer.
Example:
Input: n = 27
Output: true (since 33=273^3 = 2733=27)
Input: n = 0
Output: false (since no power of 3 can be 0)


### Approach Breakdown:

- **Brute Force**: Continuously divide the number by 3 and check if it becomes 1. This approach will simulate the mathematical process of dividing by powers of 3.
  
- **Easy Approach**: Use a loop or recursion to check divisibility by 3, and then check if the final value equals 1.

- **Moderate Approach**: Check if `n` is divisible by `3^k`, and loop until we check all possible powers.

- **Optimal Approach**: Use the property of divisibility by the largest power of 3 that fits in the range of the integer data type to avoid loops and achieve constant time complexity.

### 1. **Brute Force Approach:**

In this approach, we start from `n` and keep dividing by 3 until we can't divide anymore. If at any point `n` is not divisible by 3, it is not a power of three. If it eventually becomes 1, then it's a power of three.

#### Code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

bool isPowerOfThree(int n) {
    if (n <= 0) {
        return false;  // Powers of three cannot be less than or equal to 0
    }

    // Keep dividing by 3 as long as it's divisible
    while (n % 3 == 0) {
        n /= 3;
    }

    // If n becomes 1, then it is a power of 3
    return n == 1;
}

int main() {
    cout << isPowerOfThree(27) << endl;  // Output: true
    cout << isPowerOfThree(0) << endl;   // Output: false
    cout << isPowerOfThree(9) << endl;   // Output: true
    cout << isPowerOfThree(10) << endl;  // Output: false
    return 0;
}
```

#### Time Complexity:
- **O(log n)**: Each division by 3 reduces `n` significantly, so the time complexity is logarithmic in the base 3.

#### Space Complexity:
- **O(1)**: Only a few variables are used, no extra space.

### 2. **Easy Approach (Loop with Early Exit):**

In this approach, we perform a simpler iteration. Instead of performing multiple checks for divisibility and manually dividing, we use a loop that exits early if the number is not divisible by 3.

#### Code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

bool isPowerOfThree(int n) {
    if (n <= 0) {
        return false;  // Powers of three cannot be less than or equal to 0
    }

    // Loop to check if n is divisible by 3
    while (n > 1) {
        if (n % 3 != 0) {
            return false;  // If n is not divisible by 3, it's not a power of three
        }
        n /= 3;
    }

    return true;  // If n reduces to 1, it's a power of three
}

int main() {
    cout << isPowerOfThree(27) << endl;  // Output: true
    cout << isPowerOfThree(0) << endl;   // Output: false
    cout << isPowerOfThree(9) << endl;   // Output: true
    cout << isPowerOfThree(10) << endl;  // Output: false
    return 0;
}
```

#### Time Complexity:
- **O(log n)**: Same as the brute force approach since we are performing the same repeated division.

#### Space Complexity:
- **O(1)**: Constant space.

### 3. **Moderate Approach (Check Divisibility by Powers of Three):**

Instead of dividing repeatedly, we check if `n` is divisible by any power of 3 until it becomes greater than `n`. This approach reduces the number of checks but still involves a loop.

#### Code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

bool isPowerOfThree(int n) {
    if (n <= 0) {
        return false;  // Powers of three cannot be less than or equal to 0
    }

    int powerOfThree = 1;
    // Loop until powerOfThree exceeds n
    while (powerOfThree < n) {
        powerOfThree *= 3;
    }

    // If powerOfThree equals n, it's a power of three
    return powerOfThree == n;
}

int main() {
    cout << isPowerOfThree(27) << endl;  // Output: true
    cout << isPowerOfThree(0) << endl;   // Output: false
    cout << isPowerOfThree(9) << endl;   // Output: true
    cout << isPowerOfThree(10) << endl;  // Output: false
    return 0;
}
```

#### Time Complexity:
- **O(log n)**: We multiply `powerOfThree` by 3 until it exceeds `n`, which takes logarithmic time.

#### Space Complexity:
- **O(1)**: Constant space, just a few variables.

### 4. **Optimal Approach (Divisibility by Max Power of 3):**

This optimal approach uses the fact that the largest power of 3 that fits in a 32-bit integer is \( 3^{19} = 1162261467 \). We check if `n` divides this number, as any valid power of 3 must divide this number without a remainder.

#### Code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

bool isPowerOfThree(int n) {
    const int maxPowerOfThree = 1162261467;  // 3^19, largest power of 3 that fits in an int
    if (n <= 0) {
        return false;  // Powers of three cannot be less than or equal to 0
    }
    
    // Check if n divides maxPowerOfThree without a remainder
    return maxPowerOfThree % n == 0;
}

int main() {
    cout << isPowerOfThree(27) << endl;  // Output: true
    cout << isPowerOfThree(0) << endl;   // Output: false
    cout << isPowerOfThree(9) << endl;   // Output: true
    cout << isPowerOfThree(10) << endl;  // Output: false
    return 0;
}
```

#### Time Complexity:
- **O(1)**: This approach uses a constant-time modulus operation, which does not depend on the size of `n`.

#### Space Complexity:
- **O(1)**: Constant space usage.

### **Summary of Approaches:**

| Approach               | Time Complexity | Space Complexity | Description                                    |
|------------------------|-----------------|------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| **Brute Force**         | O(log n)        | O(1)             | Repeated division by 3 until the number becomes 1. |
| **Easy Approach**       | O(log n)        | O(1)             | Loop through division, exit early if not divisible by 3. |
| **Moderate Approach**   | O(log n)        | O(1)             | Multiply by powers of 3 until we exceed `n`. |
| **Optimal Approach**    | O(1)            | O(1)             | Use divisibility property with the largest power of 3 that fits in an integer. |

The **optimal approach** is the most efficient in terms of time complexity (constant time), while the other approaches are logarithmic in time complexity and involve repeated divisions or multiplications.
