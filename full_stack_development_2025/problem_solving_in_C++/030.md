## 30. Write a program to input an integer 'n' and print the sum of all its even digits and the sum of all its odd digits separately. Example : Input: n = 132456, Output: 12, 9
Explanation:
The sum of even digits = 2 + 4 + 6 = 12
The sum of odd digits = 1 + 3 + 5 = 9



### **Approach 1: Iterative Approach (Using Modulus and Integer Division)**

This approach uses modulus and integer division to extract each digit of the number. We iterate through the digits of the number, checking if they are even or odd, and summing them accordingly.

### **Code Implementation with Detailed Explanation:**

```cpp
#include <iostream> // Include library to use input and output functions
using namespace std; // Use the standard namespace for convenience

// Function to calculate the sum of even and odd digits separately
void sumEvenOddDigits(int n) {
    // Initializing variables to store the sum of even and odd digits
    int evenSum = 0, oddSum = 0;
    
    // Iterate through each digit of the number 'n'
    while (n > 0) {  // Keep processing digits as long as n is greater than 0
        int digit = n % 10;  // Extract the last digit of the number using modulus operator
        
        // Check if the digit is even
        if (digit % 2 == 0) {  // If the digit is divisible by 2 (even)
            evenSum += digit;  // Add the even digit to the evenSum
        } else {  // Otherwise, if the digit is odd
            oddSum += digit;  // Add the odd digit to the oddSum
        }
        
        n /= 10;  // Remove the last digit of 'n' by performing integer division
    }
    
    // Output the final sums of even and odd digits
    cout << "Sum of even digits: " << evenSum << endl;  // Print the sum of even digits
    cout << "Sum of odd digits: " << oddSum << endl;  // Print the sum of odd digits
}

int main() {
    int n;  // Declare an integer variable to store the user input
    cout << "Enter a number: ";  // Prompt the user to input a number
    cin >> n;  // Read the input number from the user
    
    // Call the function to calculate the sum of even and odd digits
    sumEvenOddDigits(n);  // Pass the input number 'n' to the function
    
    return 0;  // End of the program
}
```

### **Time Complexity Analysis:**

- The main operation in the code is the while loop (`while (n > 0)`), which iterates once for each digit of the number.
- **Time Complexity: O(d)**, where `d` is the number of digits in the integer `n`.  
   This is because the loop executes once for each digit, and the number of digits in `n` is proportional to the size of the number. For example, a 6-digit number will require 6 iterations.
  
### **Space Complexity Analysis:**

- The space used by the program is constant because we are only using a few integer variables (`evenSum`, `oddSum`, and `digit`).
- **Space Complexity: O(1)**, which means constant space usage.  
   The size of the input `n` does not affect the space used by the program since we are not storing multiple copies of the input or using any additional data structures.

### **Conclusion:**

- **Advantages of this Approach:**
  - Simple to understand and implement, as it uses basic operations (modulus and division).
  - Efficient for finding the sum of even and odd digits in a given number.
  - Low space usage (O(1)), making it suitable for environments with limited memory.

- **Drawbacks of this Approach:**
  - Requires manually processing each digit, which may not be as efficient or concise as other approaches for larger datasets.

This approach is optimal for this problem because it processes the number digit by digit without requiring additional space beyond the basic variables.
