## 50. Given a string and a character, count how many times the character appears in the string.
Input: str = "hello world", char = "o"
Output: 2

### Approaches:


### **1. Brute Force Approach (Using a Loop)**

This approach involves iterating over the string and checking each character one by one to count the occurrences.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int countOccurrences(string str, char c) {
    int count = 0;  // Initialize a counter to store the number of occurrences
    
    // Step 1: Iterate over each character in the string
    for (int i = 0; i < str.length(); i++) {
        // Step 2: If the character at position i matches the given character
        if (str[i] == c) {
            count++;  // Increment the count
        }
    }
    
    // Step 3: Return the count after iterating through the string
    return count;
}

int main() {
    string str = "hello world";  // Input string
    char c = 'o';  // Character to count
    
    int result = countOccurrences(str, c);  // Call the function
    cout << "The character '" << c << "' appears " << result << " times." << endl;  // Output the result
    
    return 0;
}
```

#### **Time Complexity**:
- **O(n)**: We have to iterate through the entire string of length `n`.

#### **Space Complexity**:
- **O(1)**: We are using a fixed amount of extra space (only the `count` variable).

---

### **2. Easy Approach (Using `std::count` from the Standard Library)**

In this approach, we use the `std::count` function from the C++ standard library, which directly counts the occurrences of a character in a string.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <algorithm>  // For std::count
using namespace std;

int countOccurrences(string str, char c) {
    // Step 1: Use std::count to count the occurrences of the character 'c' in the string
    return count(str.begin(), str.end(), c);  // std::count takes the range and the character to count
}

int main() {
    string str = "hello world";  // Input string
    char c = 'o';  // Character to count
    
    int result = countOccurrences(str, c);  // Call the function
    cout << "The character '" << c << "' appears " << result << " times." << endl;  // Output the result
    
    return 0;
}
```

#### **Time Complexity**:
- **O(n)**: `std::count` internally loops through the string to count the occurrences.

#### **Space Complexity**:
- **O(1)**: The space complexity is constant, as no extra space other than the input string is used.

---

### **3. Optimal Approach (Using Range-Based Loop)**

In this approach, we will use a range-based `for` loop, which is simpler and avoids using indices.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int countOccurrences(string str, char c) {
    int count = 0;  // Initialize a counter to store the number of occurrences
    
    // Step 1: Iterate over each character in the string using range-based for loop
    for (char ch : str) {
        // Step 2: If the current character matches the given character
        if (ch == c) {
            count++;  // Increment the count
        }
    }
    
    // Step 3: Return the count
    return count;
}

int main() {
    string str = "hello world";  // Input string
    char c = 'o';  // Character to count
    
    int result = countOccurrences(str, c);  // Call the function
    cout << "The character '" << c << "' appears " << result << " times." << endl;  // Output the result
    
    return 0;
}
```


#### **Time Complexity**:
- **O(n)**: We iterate through the string once, so the time complexity is proportional to the length of the string.

#### **Space Complexity**:
- **O(1)**: No extra space is required except for the `count` variable.

---

### **4. Approach Using a Hash Map (or Hash Set)**

In this approach, we can use a hash map (unordered_map in C++) to store the occurrences of each character. This can be an alternative if we want to count occurrences and track them more efficiently (though in this case, it may be overkill). 

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <unordered_map>  // For hash map (unordered_map)
using namespace std;

int countOccurrences(string str, char c) {
    unordered_map<char, int> freq_map;  // Create a hash map to store character frequencies
    
    // Step 1: Traverse through the string and count frequencies
    for (char ch : str) {
        freq_map[ch]++;  // Increment the frequency of the current character in the map
    }
    
    // Step 2: Return the frequency of the given character
    return freq_map[c];  // Return the count of the character 'c'
}

int main() {
    string str = "hello world";  // Input string
    char c = 'o';  // Character to count
    
    int result = countOccurrences(str, c);  // Call the function
    cout << "The character '" << c << "' appears " << result << " times." << endl;  // Output the result
    
    return 0;
}
```

#### **Time Complexity**:
- **O(n)**: We go through the string once to populate the map and another lookup for the character count.
  
#### **Space Complexity**:
- **O(n)**: We are storing all characters of the string in the map, so the space complexity is proportional to the length of the string.

---

### **5. Approach Using Recursion (Using Helper Function)**

This approach uses recursion to traverse the string and count occurrences of the character. While recursion is not the most efficient for this problem, it's an interesting alternative.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int countOccurrencesRecursive(string str, char c, int index = 0) {
    // Base Case: If the index reaches the length of the string, return 0
    if (index == str.length()) {
        return 0;
    }
    
    // Recursive Case: Check if the current character matches the given character
    int count = (str[index] == c) ? 1 : 0;  // If match found, count is 1, otherwise 0
    
    // Recurse with the next index in the string
    return count + countOccurrencesRecursive(str, c, index + 1);
}

int main() {
    string str = "hello world";  // Input string
    char c = 'o';  // Character to count
    
    int result = countOccurrencesRecursive(str, c);  // Call the recursive function
    cout << "The character '" << c << "' appears " << result << " times." << endl;  // Output the result
    
    return 0;
}
```


#### **Time Complexity**:
- **O(n)**: We are visiting each character in the string once.
  
#### **Space Complexity**:
- **O(n)**: The space complexity is due to recursion stack space, which grows linearly with the size of the input string.

---

### **6. Approach Using a Pointer (Two Pointer Technique)**

This approach uses two pointers to traverse the string. One pointer checks for the character, and the other keeps track of the count.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int countOccurrences(string str, char c) {
    int count = 0;  // Initialize a counter to store the number of occurrences
    int i = 0;  // Pointer to iterate through the string
    
    // Step 1: Traverse the string using the pointer
    while (i < str.length()) {
        if (str[i] == c) {  // If the character matches the target
            count++;  // Increment the count
        }
        i++;  // Move the pointer to the next character
    }
    
    // Step 2: Return the final count
    return count;
}

int main() {
    string str = "hello world";  // Input string
    char c = 'o';  // Character to count
    
    int result = countOccurrences(str, c);  // Call the function
    cout << "The character '" << c << "' appears " << result << " times." << endl;  // Output the result
    
    return 0;
}
```


#### **Time Complexity**:
- **O(n)**: The time complexity is linear because we only iterate over the string once.

#### **Space Complexity**:
- **O(1)**: No extra space is used except for the `count` and pointer `i`.

---

### **7. Approach Using String Stream (Using `stringstream` for String Parsing)**

In this approach, we can parse the string using `stringstream` to split characters and then count occurrences. This method is less common but can be fun to try.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <sstream>  // For stringstream
using namespace std;

int countOccurrences(string str, char c) {
    int count = 0;
    stringstream ss(str);  // Create a string stream from the input string
    char ch;
    
    // Step 1: Extract each character from the stream and count
    while (ss >> ch) {
        if (ch == c) {  // If the character matches
            count++;  // Increment the count
        }
    }
    
    // Step 2: Return the count of occurrences
    return count;
}

int main() {
    string str = "hello world";  // Input string
    char c = 'o';  // Character to count
    
    int result = countOccurrences(str, c);  // Call the function
    cout << "The character '" << c << "' appears " << result << " times." << endl;  // Output the result
    
    return 0;
}
```

#### **Time Complexity**:
- **O(n)**: The `stringstream` processes the string once, so the time complexity is linear.
  
#### **Space Complexity**:
- **O(1)**: The space complexity is constant, except for the `count` variable and temporary character `ch`.
