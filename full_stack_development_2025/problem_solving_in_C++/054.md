## 54. An ugly number is a positive integer whose prime factors only include 2, 3, and 5. Given an integer n, write a program to determine if n is an ugly number.
Example:
Input: n = 6
Output: true
Input: n = 8
Output: true
Input: n = 14
Output: false
Input: n = 1
Output: true




### **Brute Force Approach**
The brute force approach involves iterating over all integers from 2, 3, and 5 to check if these prime numbers divide `n` completely.

### Code (Brute Force Approach):

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

bool isUgly(int n) {
    if (n <= 0) {
        return false;  // Ugly numbers must be positive integers
    }

    // Brute force approach: Repeatedly divide by 2, 3, and 5
    for (int i = 2; i <= 5; i++) {
        while (n % i == 0) {  // If divisible by i, divide it
            n /= i;
        }
    }

    // After removing all factors of 2, 3, and 5, check if n is reduced to 1
    return n == 1;
}

int main() {
    int n = 6;
    cout << (isUgly(n) ? "true" : "false") << endl;  // Output should be "true"
    
    n = 8;
    cout << (isUgly(n) ? "true" : "false") << endl;  // Output should be "true"
    
    n = 14;
    cout << (isUgly(n) ? "true" : "false") << endl;  // Output should be "false"
    
    n = 1;
    cout << (isUgly(n) ? "true" : "false") << endl;  // Output should be "true"
    
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:
1. We loop through the prime factors 2, 3, and 5. If `n` is divisible by any of these, we divide `n` by that factor.
2. After dividing `n` by 2, 3, and 5 as much as possible, if `n` becomes 1, it means the number only had these factors and is therefore an ugly number.
3. If `n` is reduced to something other than 1, then it's not an ugly number.

### Time Complexity:
- The time complexity is **O(log n)** because in the worst case, we keep dividing `n` by 2, 3, and 5 until it becomes 1.

### Space Complexity:
- The space complexity is **O(1)** since we are using a constant amount of extra space.

---

### **Easy Approach**
This is almost the same as the brute force approach, but with simpler logic and a more direct approach. Instead of looping through numbers and checking divisibility, we just directly divide the number by 2, 3, and 5 and check.

### Code (Easy Approach):

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

bool isUgly(int n) {
    if (n <= 0) {
        return false;  // Ugly numbers must be positive integers
    }

    // Directly remove all factors of 2, 3, and 5
    while (n % 2 == 0) {
        n /= 2;
    }
    while (n % 3 == 0) {
        n /= 3;
    }
    while (n % 5 == 0) {
        n /= 5;
    }

    // After division, if n is 1, it's an ugly number
    return n == 1;
}

int main() {
    int n = 6;
    cout << (isUgly(n) ? "true" : "false") << endl;  // Output should be "true"
    
    n = 8;
    cout << (isUgly(n) ? "true" : "false") << endl;  // Output should be "true"
    
    n = 14;
    cout << (isUgly(n) ? "true" : "false") << endl;  // Output should be "false"
    
    n = 1;
    cout << (isUgly(n) ? "true" : "false") << endl;  // Output should be "true"
    
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:
- This approach just keeps dividing by 2, 3, and 5 until no further division is possible.
- If `n` becomes 1 after all divisions, it is an ugly number. Otherwise, it is not.

### Time Complexity:
- **O(log n)**, since we keep dividing `n` by 2, 3, and 5.

### Space Complexity:
- **O(1)**, as we are using constant space.

### **Moderate Approach**
The moderate approach works similarly but with more detailed checks. We could optimize it by using a set of prime factors (i.e., 2, 3, and 5) and then checking for divisibility.

### Code (Moderate Approach):

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <set>
using namespace std;

bool isUgly(int n) {
    if (n <= 0) {
        return false;  // Ugly numbers must be positive integers
    }

    set<int> primeFactors = {2, 3, 5};  // Set of allowed prime factors

    // Loop through allowed prime factors and remove them from n
    for (int prime : primeFactors) {
        while (n % prime == 0) {
            n /= prime;
        }
    }

    // If n is reduced to 1, it's an ugly number
    return n == 1;
}

int main() {
    int n = 6;
    cout << (isUgly(n) ? "true" : "false") << endl;  // Output should be "true"
    
    n = 8;
    cout << (isUgly(n) ? "true" : "false") << endl;  // Output should be "true"
    
    n = 14;
    cout << (isUgly(n) ? "true" : "false") << endl;  // Output should be "false"
    
    n = 1;
    cout << (isUgly(n) ? "true" : "false") << endl;  // Output should be "true"
    
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:
- We use a **set** to store the prime factors (2, 3, and 5). This approach allows us to iterate over the factors in a more organized way.
- We loop through each prime factor and remove it from `n` if it's divisible.

### Time Complexity:
- **O(log n)** for removing factors of 2, 3, and 5.

### Space Complexity:
- **O(1)** for the set containing the prime factors.

---

### **Optimal Approach**
The optimal approach is the same as the easy and moderate approach, but with added checks and a direct solution without using extra data structures.

### Code (Optimal Approach):

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

bool isUgly(int n) {
    if (n <= 0) {
        return false;  // Ugly numbers must be positive integers
    }

    // Keep dividing by 2, 3, and 5 until it can't be divided anymore
    while (n % 2 == 0) n /= 2;
    while (n % 3 == 0) n /= 3;
    while (n % 5 == 0) n /= 5;

    // If n becomes 1, it's an ugly number; otherwise, it's not
    return n == 1;
}

int main() {
    int n = 6;
    cout << (isUgly(n) ? "true" : "false") << endl;  // Output should be "true"
    
    n = 8;
    cout << (isUgly(n) ? "true" : "false") << endl;  // Output should be "true"
    
    n = 14;
    cout << (isUgly(n) ? "true" : "false") << endl;  // Output should be "false"
    
    n = 1;
    cout << (isUgly(n) ? "true" : "false") << endl;  // Output should be "true"
    
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:
- The optimal approach eliminates all unnecessary checks and directly divides the number by 2, 3, and 5.
- The result is determined by whether `n` becomes 1.

### Time Complexity:
- **O(log n)**, as we keep dividing by 2, 3, and
