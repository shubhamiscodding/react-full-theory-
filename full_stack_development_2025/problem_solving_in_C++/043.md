## 43. The "Max Consecutive Ones" problem is a common algorithmic challenge that involves finding the maximum number of consecutive 1s in a binary array.


### **Brute-Force Approach 1**

The brute-force approach examines all possible subarrays of the binary array and counts the number of consecutive `1s` in each subarray. We keep track of the maximum count.

---

#### **Code:**
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int findMaxConsecutiveOnes(int nums[], int size) {
    int max_count = 0;  // To store the maximum number of consecutive 1s

    // Loop through each element of the array as a potential starting point
    for (int i = 0; i < size; i++) {
        int current_count = 0;  // To count consecutive 1s starting from index i

        // Start counting consecutive 1s from the current index
        for (int j = i; j < size; j++) {
            if (nums[j] == 1) {
                current_count++;  // Increment the count if the current element is 1
            } else {
                break;  // Stop counting if a 0 is encountered
            }
        }

        // Update the maximum count if the current streak is larger
        if (current_count > max_count) {
            max_count = current_count;
        }
    }

    return max_count;  // Return the maximum count of consecutive 1s
}

int main() {
    // Example input
    int nums[] = {1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1};
    int size = sizeof(nums) / sizeof(nums[0]);  // Calculate the size of the array

    // Call the function and print the result
    cout << "Max Consecutive Ones: " << findMaxConsecutiveOnes(nums, size) << endl;  // Output: 3
    return 0;
}
```

### **Explanation of Code:**

1. **Outer Loop (Line 8):**
   - Starts at each index `i` in the array as the potential starting point for a sequence of `1s`.

2. **Inner Loop (Line 12):**
   - Checks the elements from the current index `i` onwards to count consecutive `1s`.
   - Stops counting when a `0` is encountered (`break` statement).

3. **Maximum Update (Line 18):**
   - Updates `max_count` if the current streak (`current_count`) is greater than the previous maximum.

4. **Result:**
   - The function returns the maximum number of consecutive `1s` found in the array.

---


### **Time Complexity:**

1. **Outer Loop:** Runs `n` times (for each element in the array).
2. **Inner Loop:** On average, runs `n/2` times (in the worst case, `n` times for each starting point).

Thus, the time complexity is:
- **O(nÂ²)** in the worst case.

---

### **Space Complexity:**
- **O(1)** because we only use a few integer variables (`max_count` and `current_count`) for counting.

---

### **Approach 2: Simple Iteration**

This approach iterates over the binary array and counts consecutive `1s`. If a `0` is encountered, the current count of consecutive `1s` is reset to `0`.

#### **Steps:**
1. Initialize two variables: one to keep track of the current streak of consecutive `1s` (`current_count`), and another to store the maximum number of consecutive `1s` (`max_count`).
2. Traverse the binary array:
   - If the current element is `1`, increment the `current_count`.
   - If the current element is `0`, update the `max_count` if the `current_count` is greater, then reset `current_count` to `0`.
3. After the loop, compare `current_count` with `max_count` again to ensure any streak at the end of the array is considered.
4. Return `max_count` as the result.

#### **Code:**
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

int findMaxConsecutiveOnes(const vector<int>& nums) {
    int max_count = 0;  // To store the maximum number of consecutive 1s
    int current_count = 0;  // To count the current streak of 1s

    for (int num : nums) {
        if (num == 1) {
            current_count++;  // Increment the streak of consecutive 1s
        } else {
            max_count = max(max_count, current_count);  // Update max_count if necessary
            current_count = 0;  // Reset the current count for 1s
        }
    }

    // Final check after the loop to compare current_count with max_count
    max_count = max(max_count, current_count);

    return max_count;  // Return the maximum count of consecutive 1s
}

int main() {
    vector<int> nums = {1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1};  // Example input
    cout << "Max Consecutive Ones: " << findMaxConsecutiveOnes(nums) << endl;  // Output: 3
    return 0;
}
```

### **Explanation:**
- **Initial Setup:** We initialize `max_count` to `0` and `current_count` to `0`.
- **Traversal:** We loop through each element of the array:
  - For `1`, we increment `current_count`.
  - For `0`, we compare `current_count` with `max_count` and reset `current_count` to `0`.
- **Final Check:** After the loop ends, we do one final comparison between `current_count` and `max_count` to handle cases where the longest streak ends at the last element of the array.
  
#### **Time Complexity:**
- **O(n)** where `n` is the length of the array. We traverse the array once.
  
#### **Space Complexity:**
- **O(1)** because we only use a few extra variables for counting, regardless of the input size.

### **Approach 3: Sliding Window**

The sliding window approach can be applied here by maintaining a window that counts consecutive `1s`. However, since the problem doesn't ask for any modifications to the array, this approach becomes very similar to the previous one.

#### **Steps:**
1. Initialize two pointers: `start` and `end` (representing the window), both starting from the beginning of the array.
2. Use `end` to expand the window by iterating over the array.
3. If a `0` is encountered within the window, shift `start` to the next position after the `0`.
4. Continue expanding and contracting the window as necessary, keeping track of the maximum number of consecutive `1s`.

However, this sliding window approach is essentially equivalent to the first approach because the array doesn't require modification, and the problem only needs a count of the maximum sequence of `1s`.

#### **Code:**
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

int findMaxConsecutiveOnes(const vector<int>& nums) {
    int max_count = 0;
    int current_count = 0;

    // Slide through the array
    for (int num : nums) {
        if (num == 1) {
            current_count++;
        } else {
            max_count = max(max_count, current_count);
            current_count = 0;
        }
    }

    // After the loop ends, do a final check
    return max(max_count, current_count);
}

int main() {
    vector<int> nums = {1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1};
    cout << "Max Consecutive Ones: " << findMaxConsecutiveOnes(nums) << endl;  // Output: 3
    return 0;
}
```

#### **Time Complexity:**
- **O(n)** because we iterate through the array once.

#### **Space Complexity:**
- **O(1)** as we only need a few extra variables.

### **Approach 4: Using Dynamic Programming (Storing Counts)**

We could also approach this using a dynamic programming method where we create an array that stores the longest streak of `1s` up to each index. This method is more involved and adds unnecessary complexity for this simple problem.

#### **Steps:**
1. Initialize a dynamic programming array `dp` where `dp[i]` represents the number of consecutive `1s` ending at index `i`.
2. Traverse the array:
   - If the current element is `1`, increment the count from the previous element (`dp[i] = dp[i-1] + 1`).
   - If the current element is `0`, set `dp[i] = 0`.
3. Track the maximum value of `dp[i]` during the traversal.

This approach is less efficient and more complex than necessary, as it requires storing additional data.

#### **Code:**
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

int findMaxConsecutiveOnes(const vector<int>& nums) {
    if (nums.empty()) return 0;

    vector<int> dp(nums.size(), 0);  // DP array to store consecutive 1s
    dp[0] = nums[0] == 1 ? 1 : 0;
    int max_count = dp[0];

    for (int i = 1; i < nums.size(); i++) {
        if (nums[i] == 1) {
            dp[i] = dp[i - 1] + 1;  // Continue the streak
        } else {
            dp[i] = 0;  // Reset the streak
        }
        max_count = max(max_count, dp[i]);  // Update max count
    }

    return max_count;
}

int main() {
    vector<int> nums = {1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1};
    cout << "Max Consecutive Ones: " << findMaxConsecutiveOnes(nums) << endl;  // Output: 3
    return 0;
}
```

#### **Time Complexity:**
- **O(n)**: We are iterating through the array once.
  
#### **Space Complexity:**
- **O(n)**: We are using an additional array `dp` of size `n` to store the results.

### **Conclusion:**
- **Approach 2** (Simple Iteration) and **Approach 3** (Sliding Window) are the most efficient for this problem, both in terms of time and space complexity.
- **Approach 4** (Dynamic Programming) is more complicated than needed, with unnecessary space overhead, and should be avoided in favor of simpler approaches.
