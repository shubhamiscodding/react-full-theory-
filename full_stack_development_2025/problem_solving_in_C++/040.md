## 40. Given two numbers, generate an array containing all numbers between them (inclusive). Example: Input: 1,5 Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]



### 1. **Brute Force Approach**:
- This is the most straightforward approach. We will iterate over the numbers from `start` to `end` and store them in an array.
- We'll use a simple fixed-size array to store the numbers.

#### Code (Brute Force Approach):

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

// Function to generate the numbers between start and end (inclusive)
void generateNumbers(int start, int end) {
    // Calculate the number of elements between start and end (inclusive)
    int size = end - start + 1;

    // Create an array to store the numbers
    int result[size];

    // Loop to fill the array with numbers between start and end
    for (int i = 0; i < size; i++) {
        result[i] = start + i;
    }

    // Print the array
    cout << "Generated Array: [";
    for (int i = 0; i < size; i++) {
        cout << result[i];
        if (i != size - 1) cout << ", ";  // Formatting output
    }
    cout << "]" << endl;
}

int main() {
    int start = 1, end = 5;  // Define the range
    generateNumbers(start, end);  // Call the function to generate the numbers

    return 0;
}
```

---

### Explanation:
- **Function**: `generateNumbers(int start, int end)`
  - The function calculates the size of the array by finding the difference between `end` and `start` and adding 1.
  - An integer array `result` of size `size` is declared to store the numbers.
  - The for loop iterates through each number between `start` and `end` and stores them in the `result` array.
  - The second loop prints the numbers in the `result` array in a comma-separated format.

---

### Time and Space Complexity Analysis:

#### Time Complexity:
- **Time Complexity**: `O(n)` where `n` is the number of elements to be generated, i.e., `end - start + 1`.
  - The first loop runs `n` times, where `n` is the number of elements between `start` and `end`. Each iteration takes constant time.
  - The second loop also runs `n` times to print the array elements.

#### Space Complexity:
- **Space Complexity**: `O(n)` where `n` is the size of the generated array.
  - We store `n` elements in the `result` array, so the space used is proportional to `n`.

---

### 2. **Alternative Approach**: Using Dynamic Memory Allocation (for fixed-size array)
- Instead of a statically-sized array, we can dynamically allocate memory for the array based on the input values using `new` in C++.
- This is similar to the brute force approach but provides more flexibility in memory allocation.

#### Code (Dynamic Allocation Approach):

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

void generateNumbers(int start, int end) {
    // Calculate the number of elements between start and end (inclusive)
    int size = end - start + 1;

    // Dynamically allocate memory for the result array
    int* result = new int[size];

    // Loop to fill the array with numbers between start and end
    for (int i = 0; i < size; i++) {
        result[i] = start + i;
    }

    // Print the array
    cout << "Generated Array: [";
    for (int i = 0; i < size; i++) {
        cout << result[i];
        if (i != size - 1) cout << ", ";  // Formatting output
    }
    cout << "]" << endl;

    // Free the dynamically allocated memory
    delete[] result;
}

int main() {
    int start = 1, end = 5;  // Define the range
    generateNumbers(start, end);  // Call the function to generate the numbers

    return 0;
}
```

---

### Explanation:
- **Dynamic Memory Allocation**: 
  - Instead of using a fixed-size array, we dynamically allocate memory for the `result` array using `new int[size]`.
  - This allows us to avoid manually calculating the array size upfront if we were dealing with larger or unknown sizes.
  - After using the dynamically allocated memory, we free the memory using `delete[]`.

---

### Time and Space Complexity Analysis:

#### Time Complexity:
- **Time Complexity**: `O(n)` where `n` is the number of elements between `start` and `end`. The time complexity remains the same as the brute force approach because the logic is essentially the same.

#### Space Complexity:
- **Space Complexity**: `O(n)` for storing the array. However, dynamic allocation gives more flexibility in terms of memory management compared to static arrays.

---

### 3. **Alternative Approach**: Using Recursion (Recursive Approach)

- Instead of using loops, we can use recursion to generate the numbers between `start` and `end`. This approach would be more educational to teach recursion but is not as efficient for large inputs.

#### Code (Recursive Approach):

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

void generateNumbersRecursive(int start, int end) {
    // Base case: when start > end, we stop the recursion
    if (start > end) return;

    // Print the current number
    cout << start;
    if (start != end) cout << ", ";  // Formatting output

    // Recursive call with the next number
    generateNumbersRecursive(start + 1, end);
}

int main() {
    int start = 1, end = 5;  // Define the range
    cout << "Generated Array: [";
    generateNumbersRecursive(start, end);  // Call the recursive function to print numbers
    cout << "]" << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

---

### Explanation:
- **Function**: `generateNumbersRecursive(int start, int end)`
  - The function checks if `start` is greater than `end`. If so, it terminates (base case).
  - It prints the current value of `start` and calls itself with `start + 1`.
  - This continues until `start` exceeds `end`.

---

### Time and Space Complexity Analysis:

#### Time Complexity:
- **Time Complexity**: `O(n)` where `n` is the difference between `start` and `end` because we recursively call the function `n` times.

#### Space Complexity:
- **Space Complexity**: `O(n)` due to the recursive calls that occupy the call stack. The depth of recursion is proportional to `n`.

---

### Conclusion:

- **Brute Force Approach**: The simplest and most straightforward. Time complexity is `O(n)` and space complexity is also `O(n)` for the generated array.
- **Dynamic Memory Allocation**: Provides more flexibility with memory. Time complexity remains `O(n)`, but dynamic memory allocation and deallocation are extra steps.
- **Recursive Approach**: Offers an alternative using recursion. However, it may be inefficient for large ranges due to the recursive stack, which could lead to stack overflow for large values of `n`.
