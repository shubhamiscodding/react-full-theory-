## 33. Write a program that takes a year as input and checks whether it is a century year (a year divisible by 100).
### Problem Explanation:
The function isCenturyYear takes a parameter year.

It checks if the year is divisible by 100 using the modulus operator (%):

If year % 100 === 0, it prints that the year is a century year.

Otherwise, it prints that it is not a century year.

### **Approach 1: Using Modulus Operator with If-Else**

This is the most straightforward approach where we use the modulus operator (`%`) to check if the year is divisible by 100.

#### **Code:**

```cpp
#include <iostream>  // Include standard input-output library
using namespace std;

void isCenturyYear(int year) {
    // Check if the year is divisible by 100 using the modulus operator
    if (year % 100 == 0) {
        cout << year << " is a Century Year." << endl;  // Print if it's a century year
    } else {
        cout << year << " is not a Century Year." << endl;  // Print if it's not a century year
    }
}

int main() {
    int year;  // Declare an integer variable to store the year

    cout << "Enter a year: ";  // Ask the user to input a year
    cin >> year;  // Take input from the user

    isCenturyYear(year);  // Call the function to check and print the result

    return 0;  // Exit the program successfully
}
```

#### **Time Complexity:**
- **O(1)**: The modulus operation and the conditional check are constant-time operations, so the program runs in constant time regardless of the input year.

#### **Space Complexity:**
- **O(1)**: The program uses a constant amount of space, only storing the `year` variable.

---

### **Approach 2: Using Ternary Operator**

In this approach, we use the ternary operator (`?:`), which is a shorthand way of writing an if-else statement in a single line.

#### **Code:**

```cpp
#include <iostream>  
using namespace std;

void isCenturyYear(int year) {
    // Using the ternary operator to check if the year is divisible by 100
    (year % 100 == 0) ? cout << year << " is a Century Year." << endl 
                      : cout << year << " is not a Century Year." << endl;
}

int main() {
    int year;  // Declare an integer variable to store the year
    cout << "Enter a year: ";  // Ask for input
    cin >> year;  // Take input from the user

    isCenturyYear(year);  // Call the function to check and print the result
    return 0;  // Exit the program successfully
}
```

#### **Time Complexity:**
- **O(1)**: The ternary operator performs the same modulus operation and conditional check as the `if-else`, so the time complexity remains constant.

#### **Space Complexity:**
- **O(1)**: The space complexity is constant because only one variable (`year`) is used, and no additional data structures are required.

---

### **Approach 3: Using Logical AND (&&) in a Single Expression**

This approach combines the condition and the output using the logical AND (`&&`) operator. It uses a single expression to check if the year is divisible by 100.

#### **Code:**

```cpp
#include <iostream>  
using namespace std;

void isCenturyYear(int year) {
    // Using logical AND to combine condition and print in one line
    (year % 100 == 0) && cout << year << " is a Century Year." << endl;
    (year % 100 != 0) && cout << year << " is not a Century Year." << endl;
}

int main() {
    int year;  // Declare an integer variable to store the year
    cout << "Enter a year: ";  // Ask the user to input a year
    cin >> year;  // Take input from the user

    isCenturyYear(year);  // Call the function to check and print the result
    return 0;  // Exit the program successfully
}
```

#### **Time Complexity:**
- **O(1)**: This approach performs two modulus operations, both of which are constant time operations.

#### **Space Complexity:**
- **O(1)**: The space complexity is constant, as the program only uses one variable (`year`) and no extra space for data structures.

---

### **Approach 4: Using Switch-Case (Alternative)**

This approach uses the `switch-case` statement, which is not the most typical for this kind of check, but it can still be used for this task.

#### **Code:**

```cpp
#include <iostream>  
using namespace std;

void isCenturyYear(int year) {
    // Using switch-case to check if the year is divisible by 100
    switch (year % 100 == 0) {
        case true:
            cout << year << " is a Century Year." << endl;
            break;
        case false:
            cout << year << " is not a Century Year." << endl;
            break;
    }
}

int main() {
    int year;  // Declare an integer variable to store the year
    cout << "Enter a year: ";  // Ask for input
    cin >> year;  // Take input from the user

    isCenturyYear(year);  // Call the function to check and print the result
    return 0;  // Exit the program successfully
}
```

#### **Time Complexity:**
- **O(1)**: The modulus operation and the `switch-case` logic both operate in constant time, so the overall time complexity is constant.

#### **Space Complexity:**
- **O(1)**: The space complexity remains constant, as only a single variable (`year`) is used for input storage.

### **Summary of Approaches**

1. **Approach 1: Using Modulus Operator with If-Else**
   - **Time Complexity:** O(1)
   - **Space Complexity:** O(1)

   - **Time Complexity:** O(1)
   - **Space Complexity:** O(1)
   - **Explanation:** This approach is more compact, using the ternary operator for conditional checks and output.

3. **Approach 3: Using Logical AND (&&)**
   - **Time Complexity:** O(1)
   - **Space Complexity:** O(1)
   - **Explanation:** The logical AND operator combines the condition and action in a more compact form, although it may be harder to read for beginners.

4. **Approach 4: Using Switch-Case**
   - **Time Complexity:** O(1)
   - **Space Complexity:** O(1)
   - **Explanation:** Although not ideal for this case, the `switch-case` structure can still be used to check divisibility by 100. This approach is more useful for discrete values but is included here for variety.

### **Conclusion:**

- **All approaches have O(1) time and space complexity**, meaning they perform the check in constant time and use a constant amount of memory, regardless of the size of the input.
- **Approach 1 (if-else)** is the most straightforward and intuitive for checking if a year is a century year.
- **Approach 2 (ternary operator)** provides a more compact solution.
- **Approach 3 (logical AND)** is an unconventional but valid solution.
- **Approach 4 (switch-case)** is the least recommended but is included for variety.
