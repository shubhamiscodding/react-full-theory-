## 34. Access and print the first and last element of the array arr = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]. Output:[10,50]



### **Approach 1: Direct Access**

This approach accesses the first and last elements of the array directly using their indices. In C++, array indexing starts at 0, so the first element is at index `0` and the last element is at index `n-1`, where `n` is the length of the array.

#### **Code:**

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    // Initialize the array
    int arr[] = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50};

    // Directly access and print the first and last elements
    cout << "[" << arr[0] << ", " << arr[4] << "]" << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

#### **Explanation:**
- `arr[0]`: This accesses the first element of the array, which is `10`.
- `arr[4]`: This accesses the last element of the array, which is `50` (since there are 5 elements, the last one is at index `4`).

#### **Time Complexity:**
- **O(1)**: Accessing elements by index is a constant-time operation.

#### **Space Complexity:**
- **O(1)**: The space complexity is constant because we are only working with the original array and not using any additional memory.

### **Approach 2: Using a Loop**

This approach uses a loop to traverse the array, and prints the first and last elements explicitly when `i == 0` (first element) or `i == n-1` (last element). This approach is more generalized, but still achieves the same goal.

#### **Code:**

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int arr[] = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50};
    int n = sizeof(arr) / sizeof(arr[0]);  // Calculate number of elements in the array
    
    // Loop to print the first and last element
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        if (i == 0 || i == n - 1) {
            cout << arr[i] << " ";
        }
    }
    cout << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

#### **Explanation:**
- `sizeof(arr) / sizeof(arr[0])`: This calculates the number of elements in the array by dividing the total size of the array by the size of one element. For this example, it returns `5`.
- The loop iterates through the array, and `if (i == 0 || i == n - 1)` checks if the index `i` is either `0` (the first element) or `n-1` (the last element).
- If the condition is true, the element is printed.

#### **Time Complexity:**
- **O(n)**: The loop iterates through all the elements of the array. For an array of size `n`, this results in `n` iterations. However, we are only printing the first and last elements, so the operation is still linear in terms of iteration but constant in terms of output.

#### **Space Complexity:**
- **O(1)**: The space complexity is constant because we are not using any additional space, except for the loop variables.

---

### **Approach 3: Using STL (Standard Template Library) or Array Size Calculation**

This approach is similar to Approach 1, but it dynamically calculates the size of the array and accesses the first and last elements using the calculated size.

#### **Code:**

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    // Initialize the array
    int arr[] = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50};

    // Print the first and last elements using direct access
    cout << "[" << arr[0] << ", " << arr[sizeof(arr)/sizeof(arr[0]) - 1] << "]" << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

#### **Explanation:**
- `sizeof(arr) / sizeof(arr[0])`: This calculates the length of the array (`n`). 
- `arr[sizeof(arr) / sizeof(arr[0]) - 1]`: This accesses the last element using the calculated size. `sizeof(arr) / sizeof(arr[0]) - 1` gives the index of the last element.
- This approach is a little more flexible if you donâ€™t know the size of the array beforehand.

#### **Time Complexity:**
- **O(1)**: The array size is computed with `sizeof` which is a constant-time operation. Then accessing the first and last elements is also constant-time.

#### **Space Complexity:**
- **O(1)**: The space complexity is constant because we are not using any additional memory beyond the original array.

### **Summary of Approaches:**

| Approach                      | Code Simplicity     | Time Complexity | Space Complexity | Explanation                                                     |

### **Conclusion:**

- **Approach 1** is the most efficient for this task as it provides **O(1)** time and space complexity and doesn't require any extra computation.
- **Approach 2** uses a loop, which is less efficient in terms of time complexity (O(n)), but it's still valid for more generalized scenarios, especially when you need to do something with all elements.
- **Approach 3** is optimal and flexible, especially when working with arrays where the length is not known in advance, and you want to dynamically calculate the size.

For this problem, **Approach 1** is the most efficient and simplest solution.
