## 19. Check if the array arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] is sorted in ascending order, and print true or false.

### **1. Brute Force Approach**

In this approach, we simply check every consecutive pair of elements in the array to determine if they are in ascending order. If we find any pair where the current element is greater than the next one, the array is **not sorted**. If we finish checking all pairs and find no such pair, the array is **sorted**.

#### Code:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

bool isSortedBruteForce(int arr[], int size) {
    for (int i = 0; i < size - 1; i++) {  // Loop through the array
        if (arr[i] > arr[i + 1]) {         // Compare each element with the next one
            return false;                  // If an element is greater than the next, return false
        }
    }
    return true;  // If the loop completes without returning false, the array is sorted
}

int main() {
    int arr[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
    int size = sizeof(arr) / sizeof(arr[0]);

    bool result = isSortedBruteForce(arr, size);
    if (result) {
        cout << "True" << endl;  // The array is sorted
    } else {
        cout << "False" << endl; // The array is not sorted
    }

    return 0;
}
```

#### **Explanation:**
- **Looping through the array**: We go through each element (except the last one) and compare it with the next element.
- **Comparison**: If any element is greater than the next, we return `false` immediately.
- **If no element is greater than the next one**: We return `true`, indicating the array is sorted.

#### **Time Complexity**:
- The **time complexity** is \(O(n)\) because we loop through all \(n-1\) elements and compare each one with the next. For an array of size \(n\), this requires \(n-1\) comparisons.
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(1)\), because we only use a constant amount of extra space (for variables like `i`, `size`, and the `result`).

### **2. Optimized Approach (Early Exit)**

In this approach, we use the same basic idea as the brute force method, but we improve it by exiting early as soon as we find a pair of elements where the current one is greater than the next. This avoids unnecessary comparisons once we know the array is not sorted.

#### Code:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

bool isSortedOptimized(int arr[], int size) {
    for (int i = 0; i < size - 1; i++) {
        if (arr[i] > arr[i + 1]) {  // Check if the current element is greater than the next
            return false;            // If so, return false immediately
        }
    }
    return true;  // If no such pair is found, the array is sorted
}

int main() {
    int arr[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
    int size = sizeof(arr) / sizeof(arr[0]);

    bool result = isSortedOptimized(arr, size);
    if (result) {
        cout << "True" << endl;  // Array is sorted
    } else {
        cout << "False" << endl; // Array is not sorted
    }

    return 0;
}
```

#### **Explanation:**
- **Early exit**: As soon as we find an element that is greater than the next one, we return `false` immediately. This means we don't have to check the rest of the array once we've already determined it's unsorted.
- **Efficient for unsorted arrays**: If the array is unsorted early on (e.g., the first few elements), this approach will save time.

#### **Time Complexity**:
- **Time Complexity**: \(O(n)\). Even though we have an early exit, we still might end up checking every pair in the worst case (if the array is sorted). However, in the best case (if the array is unsorted at the beginning), we exit early.
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(1)\), since no extra space is used besides a few variables.

### **3. One-Line Approach (Concise)**

This approach is just a more compact version of the optimized approach, using a more compact syntax, often leveraging a library function for simplicity.

#### Code:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

bool isSortedConcise(int arr[], int size) {
    return std::is_sorted(arr, arr + size);  // Use the is_sorted function from the algorithm library
}

int main() {
    int arr[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
    int size = sizeof(arr) / sizeof(arr[0]);

    bool result = isSortedConcise(arr, size);
    if (result) {
        cout << "True" << endl;  // Array is sorted
    } else {
        cout << "False" << endl; // Array is not sorted
    }

    return 0;
}
```

#### **Explanation**:
- **Using `is_sorted` function**: The `is_sorted` function from the C++ Standard Library checks whether a range (in this case, the whole array) is sorted in ascending order.
- **Compact code**: This solution is very concise and efficient for situations where you can use built-in functions.

#### **Time Complexity**:
- **Time Complexity**: \(O(n)\), since the `is_sorted` function checks all the elements to verify if they are in ascending order.
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(1)\), since it doesn't require any extra space beyond the initial input array.

### **Comparison of All Approaches:**

| **Approach**                     | **Time Complexity** | **Space Complexity** | **Explanation** |
|-----------------------------------|---------------------|----------------------|-----------------|
| **Brute Force Approach**          | \(O(n)\)            | \(O(1)\)             | Check every consecutive pair of elements. |
| **Optimized Approach (Early Exit)** | \(O(n)\)            | \(O(1)\)             | Exit early when an unsorted pair is found. |
| **One-Line Approach (Concise)**   | \(O(n)\)            | \(O(1)\)             | Uses `is_sorted` from the C++ Standard Library for simplicity. |

- **Time Complexity** for all approaches is \(O(n)\) because, in the worst case, we still need to check each element of the array to determine if it's sorted.
- **Space Complexity** is \(O(1)\) for all solutions, as we only use a fixed amount of additional memory (a few variables).

### **Conclusion:**
- The **brute force approach** is simple to understand and easy to implement, especially for beginners.
- The **optimized approach** introduces the concept of early exit, which is more efficient when the array is unsorted early on, but it requires the programmer to handle the logic explicitly.
- The **one-line approach** is the most concise and leverages a built-in library function, making it efficient and easy to use in C++ when available.

For beginners, it's good to first learn the brute force approach and then gradually explore the more optimized and concise solutions.
