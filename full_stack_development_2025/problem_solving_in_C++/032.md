## 32.Write a program that categorizes a personâ€™s age group based on the given age:

### **Approach 1: Brute Force (Simple `if-else` Conditions)**

In this approach, we use simple `if-else` conditions to check the given age and print the corresponding age group.

### **Code with Detailed Explanation:**

```cpp
#include <iostream> // Include library for input-output operations
using namespace std; // Use the standard namespace to avoid the need to prefix with std::

void categorizeAgeGroup(int age) {
    // Check if the age is less than 13
    if (age < 13) {
        cout << "Child" << endl;  // If age is less than 13, print "Child"
    }
    // Check if the age is between 13 and 19 (inclusive)
    else if (age >= 13 && age <= 19) {
        cout << "Teenager" << endl;  // If age is between 13 and 19, print "Teenager"
    }
    // Check if the age is between 20 and 59 (inclusive)
    else if (age >= 20 && age <= 59) {
        cout << "Adult" << endl;  // If age is between 20 and 59, print "Adult"
    }
    // Check if the age is 60 or above
    else if (age >= 60) {
        cout << "Senior" << endl;  // If age is 60 or above, print "Senior"
    }
    else {
        cout << "Invalid age" << endl;  // This block is not necessary but can be used to catch edge cases like negative age
    }
}

int main() {
    int age;  // Declare an integer variable to store the age

    cout << "Enter age: ";  // Prompt the user to enter their age
    cin >> age;  // Take age input from the user

    categorizeAgeGroup(age);  // Call the function to categorize the entered age

    return 0;  // Indicate successful program execution
}
```
### **Time and Space Complexity Analysis:**

- **Time Complexity**:  
  - The time complexity of this solution is **O(1)**, meaning it runs in constant time regardless of the input size. 
  - The program simply checks a series of conditions (`if-else` blocks) which is a constant time operation.
  
- **Space Complexity**:
  - The space complexity is also **O(1)** because we only store the age in a single integer variable. The memory used does not grow with the size of the input.
  
### **Conclusion:**
- This approach is simple and easy to understand, using basic `if-else` conditions to categorize the age.
- It is a brute force solution with constant time and space complexities, making it efficient for small inputs.

### **Optimizing Further (Using Switch-Case)**

In this case, using a `switch-case` would not necessarily optimize the solution in terms of performance, as the `switch-case` is generally more efficient for fixed integer values or known ranges, but the `if-else` structure is more appropriate for ranges like these. Therefore, the brute-force solution with `if-else` remains the most practical and efficient approach for this specific problem.

### **Time Complexity of Optimized Approach:**
- Even with optimization, the time complexity remains **O(1)** since it still only involves checking conditions for age.
Certainly! Below is the revised program using `switch-case` to categorize a person's age, and detailed comments explaining each line. I'll also include the time and space complexity analysis.

### **Approach: Using Switch-Case**

While a `switch-case` statement is typically useful when checking for specific integer values, we can still use it in a more creative way. In this case, we can use the `age` variable divided into ranges and then switch based on the range it falls into. However, we will need to use a little trick to handle the ranges.
## code:
#include <iostream>  // Include the input-output stream library
using namespace std;  // Use the standard namespace to avoid prefixing std::

void categorizeAgeGroup(int age) {
    // Convert the age into categories by dividing it into chunks to use in switch
    int ageCategory;  

    // Determine which age category the person belongs to
    if (age < 13) {
        ageCategory = 0;  // Child category
    } 
    else if (age >= 13 && age <= 19) {
        ageCategory = 1;  // Teenager category
    } 
    else if (age >= 20 && age <= 59) {
        ageCategory = 2;  // Adult category
    } 
    else if (age >= 60) {
        ageCategory = 3;  // Senior category
    }
    else {
        ageCategory = -1;  // Invalid age category (edge case handling)
    }

    // Switch case based on the ageCategory value
    switch(ageCategory) {
        case 0:
            cout << "Child" << endl;  // If age is less than 13, print "Child"
            break;
        case 1:
            cout << "Teenager" << endl;  // If age is between 13 and 19, print "Teenager"
            break;
        case 2:
            cout << "Adult" << endl;  // If age is between 20 and 59, print "Adult"
            break;
        case 3:
            cout << "Senior" << endl;  // If age is 60 or above, print "Senior"
            break;
        default:
            cout << "Invalid age" << endl;  // This case handles any invalid input (negative age)
            break;
    }
}

int main() {
    int age;  // Declare a variable to store the age

    cout << "Enter age: ";  // Ask user to enter their age
    cin >> age;  // Take the input from the user

    categorizeAgeGroup(age);  // Call the function to categorize and print the result based on age

    return 0;  // Return 0 to indicate successful program completion
}

## Time and Space Complexity Analysis:
### Time Complexity:

The time complexity of this solution is O(1).
The program checks a series of conditions to determine the ageCategory and uses the switch-case to match the category.
All operations take constant time (checking conditions, assignment, and printing).
Therefore, the total time complexity remains O(1).
### Space Complexity:

The space complexity is also O(1).
The program only uses a small, fixed amount of memory to store the integer age and ageCategory.
No additional memory structures (like arrays, vectors, or dynamic memory allocations) are used.
Thus, the space complexity is constant, O(1).

## Conclusion:
The use of the switch-case structure in this case offers a more structured way of categorizing the age groups, although it's less common for checking ranges.
This approach still operates in constant time and space, making it very efficient for this problem.
The program is simple and easy to understand, and using switch-case adds a layer of organization when dealing with predefined categories.
