## 37. Given a sorted array and a target value, return the starting and ending position of that target in the array.Example:Input: [5, 7, 7, 8, 8, 10], target=8 ,Output: [3, 4]


### Key Concepts:
1. **Linear Search**: We can scan through the array to find the first and last occurrences of the target.
2. **Binary Search**: Since the array is sorted, binary search can help us find the target more efficiently.
3. **Space Complexity**: We will try to minimize the extra memory used while solving the problem.

### **Approach 1: Brute-force (Linear Search)**

In this approach, we simply scan the array to find the first and last occurrence of the target by going through each element one by one.

#### **Steps:**
1. Traverse the array from the beginning to the end.
2. Find the first occurrence and store its index.
3. Continue traversing the array and update the last occurrence index whenever we encounter the target.

#### **Code Implementation (Brute-force):**

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

void searchRange(int arr[], int size, int target) {
    int start = -1, end = -1;
    
    // Traverse the array to find first and last occurrence
    for (int i = 0; i < size; i++) {
        if (arr[i] == target) {
            if (start == -1) {
                start = i;  // First occurrence
            }
            end = i;  // Last occurrence (updated every time target is found)
        }
    }
    
    // Print the result
    if (start == -1) {
        cout << "[-1, -1]" << endl;  // Target not found
    } else {
        cout << "[" << start << ", " << end << "]" << endl;  // Print positions
    }
}

int main() {
    int arr[] = {5, 7, 7, 8, 8, 10};
    int size = sizeof(arr) / sizeof(arr[0]);  // Calculate the number of elements in the array
    int target = 8;
    
    searchRange(arr, size, target);  // Call the function to find the positions
    return 0;
}
```

#### **Time and Space Complexity (Brute-force):**
- **Time Complexity:** O(n), where `n` is the number of elements in the array. We have to go through the entire array once to find the target.
- **Space Complexity:** O(1), because we are only using a constant amount of extra space (the `start` and `end` variables).

---

### **Approach 2: Using Two Linear Searches (Finding First and Last Occurrence)**

This approach uses two linear searches: one for finding the first occurrence of the target and another for finding the last occurrence.

#### **Steps:**
1. **First Search:** Start from the beginning of the array and find the first occurrence of the target.
2. **Second Search:** Start from the end of the array and find the last occurrence of the target.

#### **Code Implementation (Two Linear Searches):**

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

// Function to find the first occurrence of the target
int findFirst(int arr[], int size, int target) {
    for (int i = 0; i < size; i++) {
        if (arr[i] == target)
            return i;
    }
    return -1;
}

// Function to find the last occurrence of the target
int findLast(int arr[], int size, int target) {
    for (int i = size - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
        if (arr[i] == target)
            return i;
    }
    return -1;
}

void searchRange(int arr[], int size, int target) {
    int first = findFirst(arr, size, target);
    if (first == -1) {
        cout << "[-1, -1]" << endl;  // Target not found
        return;
    }
    int last = findLast(arr, size, target);
    cout << "[" << first << ", " << last << "]" << endl;  // Print positions
}

int main() {
    int arr[] = {5, 7, 7, 8, 8, 10};
    int size = sizeof(arr) / sizeof(arr[0]);
    int target = 8;
    
    searchRange(arr, size, target);
    return 0;
}
```

#### **Time and Space Complexity (Two Linear Searches):**
- **Time Complexity:** O(n) for each linear scan, but since we are doing two linear scans, the total time complexity is still **O(n)**.
- **Space Complexity:** O(1), because we are only using a constant amount of extra space.

### **Approach 3: Using Binary Search (Optimal for Sorted Arrays)**

Since the array is sorted, binary search is an optimal approach to find the target's first and last occurrence efficiently. We perform two binary searches:
1. One to find the **first occurrence** of the target.
2. One to find the **last occurrence** of the target.

#### **Steps:**
1. Perform a binary search to find the **first occurrence**.
2. Perform another binary search to find the **last occurrence**.

#### **Code Implementation (Binary Search):**

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

// Function to find the leftmost occurrence of the target
int findLeft(int arr[], int size, int target) {
    int left = 0, right = size - 1, result = -1;
    
    while (left <= right) {
        int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
        if (arr[mid] == target) {
            result = mid;
            right = mid - 1;  // Move left to find the first occurrence
        } else if (arr[mid] < target) {
            left = mid + 1;
        } else {
            right = mid - 1;
        }
    }
    
    return result;
}

// Function to find the rightmost occurrence of the target
int findRight(int arr[], int size, int target) {
    int left = 0, right = size - 1, result = -1;
    
    while (left <= right) {
        int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
        if (arr[mid] == target) {
            result = mid;
            left = mid + 1;  // Move right to find the last occurrence
        } else if (arr[mid] < target) {
            left = mid + 1;
        } else {
            right = mid - 1;
        }
    }
    
    return result;
}

void searchRange(int arr[], int size, int target) {
    int first = findLeft(arr, size, target);
    if (first == -1) {
        cout << "[-1, -1]" << endl;  // Target not found
        return;
    }
    int last = findRight(arr, size, target);
    cout << "[" << first << ", " << last << "]" << endl;  // Print positions
}

int main() {
    int arr[] = {5, 7, 7, 8, 8, 10};
    int size = sizeof(arr) / sizeof(arr[0]);
    int target = 8;
    
    searchRange(arr, size, target);
    return 0;
}
```

#### **Time and Space Complexity (Binary Search):**
- **Time Complexity:** O(log n) for each binary search (finding the leftmost and rightmost). Hence, the total time complexity is **O(log n)**.
- **Space Complexity:** O(1), as we are using a constant amount of extra space.
