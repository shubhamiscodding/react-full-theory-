### Summary of Key Differences:
1. **C++** supports **object-oriented programming**, whereas **C** is purely procedural.
2. **C++** has a richer **standard library** (STL) for handling data structures like vectors, sets, maps, and algorithms.
3. **C++** supports advanced features like **templates**, **operator overloading**, and **exception handling**, which are not present in **C**.
4. **C++** has better **type safety** and **memory management** features (e.g., `new`/`delete` operators), while **C** relies on manual management with `malloc()` and `free()`.
5. **C++** supports **multithreading** natively (C++11 and beyond), whereas **C** does not have built-in multithreading support.

These differences make **C++** more suited for large-scale, complex applications, especially when object-oriented design and generic programming are required. **C**, on the other hand, is often preferred for low-level, system programming due to its simplicity and fine control over hardware and memory.
