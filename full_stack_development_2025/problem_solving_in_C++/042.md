## 42. Given two lists of events. Each event is represented by a start time and an end time. You need to determine if the two events conflict, which means if the events overlap in time.
---
### **Approach 1: Direct Comparison (Brute Force)**
In this approach, we directly compare the start and end times of both events to check for overlap.

#### **Steps:**
1. If `event1` ends before `event2` starts (`event1_end <= event2_start`), then there is no overlap.
2. If `event2` ends before `event1` starts (`event2_end <= event1_start`), then there is no overlap.
3. Otherwise, the events overlap.

#### **Code:**
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

bool haveConflict(int event1_start, int event1_end, int event2_start, int event2_end) {
    // Check if event1 ends before event2 starts, or event2 ends before event1 starts
    if (event1_end <= event2_start || event2_end <= event1_start) {
        return false;  // No conflict
    }
    return true;  // Events overlap
}

int main() {
    int event1_start = 1, event1_end = 5;
    int event2_start = 5, event2_end = 10;
    cout << (haveConflict(event1_start, event1_end, event2_start, event2_end) ? "true" : "false") << endl;  // Output: false

    event1_start = 1, event1_end = 5;
    event2_start = 2, event2_end = 3;
    cout << (haveConflict(event1_start, event1_end, event2_start, event2_end) ? "true" : "false") << endl;  // Output: true

    return 0;
}
```

#### **Time Complexity:**
- **O(1)**: We are only performing a few conditional checks.
  
#### **Space Complexity:**
- **O(1)**: No extra space is used.

### **Approach 2: Inclusive/Exclusive Boundary Check**
In this approach, we make a small modification by explicitly checking the conditions where the events might meet exactly at the boundary (e.g., one event ends when the other starts).

#### **Steps:**
1. If `event1_end == event2_start` or `event2_end == event1_start`, we consider it as non-overlapping because one ends where the other starts.
2. Otherwise, the overlap check remains the same as in Approach 1.

#### **Code:**
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

bool haveConflict(int event1_start, int event1_end, int event2_start, int event2_end) {
    // If one event ends exactly when the other starts, there is no conflict
    if (event1_end == event2_start || event2_end == event1_start) {
        return false;
    }
    // Check if there is no overlap
    if (event1_end <= event2_start || event2_end <= event1_start) {
        return false;  // No conflict
    }
    return true;  // Events overlap
}

int main() {
    int event1_start = 1, event1_end = 5;
    int event2_start = 5, event2_end = 10;
    cout << (haveConflict(event1_start, event1_end, event2_start, event2_end) ? "true" : "false") << endl;  // Output: false

    event1_start = 1, event1_end = 5;
    event2_start = 2, event2_end = 3;
    cout << (haveConflict(event1_start, event1_end, event2_start, event2_end) ? "true" : "false") << endl;  // Output: true

    return 0;
}
```

#### **Time Complexity:**
- **O(1)**: We are performing constant time comparisons.

#### **Space Complexity:**
- **O(1)**: No extra space is used.

### **Approach 3: Using Arrays (Explicit Representation)**
In this approach, we use arrays to explicitly represent the start and end times of the events. We perform the same comparison logic as in the previous approaches, but now with array inputs.

#### **Steps:**
1. Represent the events as arrays, such as `event1 = [start1, end1]` and `event2 = [start2, end2]`.
2. Perform the comparison to check for overlap, just like in Approach 1.

#### **Code:**
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

bool haveConflict(int event1[], int event2[]) {
    // If event1 ends before event2 starts, or event2 ends before event1 starts
    if (event1[1] <= event2[0] || event2[1] <= event1[0]) {
        return false;  // No conflict
    }
    return true;  // Events overlap
}

int main() {
    int event1[] = {1, 5};
    int event2[] = {5, 10};
    cout << (haveConflict(event1, event2) ? "true" : "false") << endl;  // Output: false

    int event1_2[] = {1, 5};
    int event2_2[] = {2, 3};
    cout << (haveConflict(event1_2, event2_2) ? "true" : "false") << endl;  // Output: true

    return 0;
}
```

#### **Time Complexity:**
- **O(1)**: We are just accessing two arrays and comparing their values.

#### **Space Complexity:**
- **O(1)**: The space is constant since we are not using any additional space beyond the arrays representing the events.

---

### **Approach 4: Using a Helper Function**
In this approach, we extract the conflict-checking logic into a helper function to improve code modularity and readability. The function performs the same comparisons but is isolated for reuse and clarity.

#### **Steps:**
1. Define a helper function `isConflict` that takes the start and end times of the two events and checks for conflict.
2. Call this helper function from the main logic to perform the check.

#### **Code:**
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

bool isConflict(int event1_start, int event1_end, int event2_start, int event2_end) {
    // If event1 ends before event2 starts, or event2 ends before event1 starts
    return !(event1_end <= event2_start || event2_end <= event1_start);
}

int main() {
    int event1_start = 1, event1_end = 5;
    int event2_start = 5, event2_end = 10;
    cout << (isConflict(event1_start, event1_end, event2_start, event2_end) ? "true" : "false") << endl;  // Output: false

    event1_start = 1, event1_end = 5;
    event2_start = 2, event2_end = 3;
    cout << (isConflict(event1_start, event1_end, event2_start, event2_end) ? "true" : "false") << endl;  // Output: true

    return 0;
}
```

#### **Time Complexity:**
- **O(1)**: The helper function performs constant time checks.

#### **Space Complexity:**
- **O(1)**: The space is constant since no extra data structures are used, only simple variables.

### **Comparison of Approaches:**

| Approach                          | Time Complexity | Space Complexity |
|------------------------------------|-----------------|------------------|
| **Approach 1**: Direct Comparison  | O(1)            | O(1)             |
| **Approach 2**: Inclusive/Exclusive Boundary Check | O(1)            | O(1)             |
| **Approach 3**: Using Arrays       | O(1)            | O(1)             |
| **Approach 4**: Helper Function    | O(1)            | O(1)             |

### **Conclusion:**
All four approaches are highly efficient and have constant time and space complexities, as we are only performing a few comparisons for each pair of events. The choice of approach depends on how you prefer to structure your code:
- If you're just looking for simplicity, **Approach 1** is fine.
- If you want a more modular design, **Approach 4** with a helper function might be the best.
- **Approach 3** (using arrays) is useful if you prefer working with arrays for representing events.
