## 45. Given a sentence, return the longest word in it.
Input: "I love programming in JavaScript"
Output: "programming"


### **Approach 1: Brute Force Approach**

In this approach, we will first split the sentence into words and store them in a vector. Then, we will iterate through the vector to find the word with the maximum length.

#### **Code (Brute Force Approach):**

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <sstream>
#include <string>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

string findLongestWordBruteForce(const string& sentence) {
    stringstream ss(sentence); // Create a stringstream to split the sentence into words
    vector<string> words;      // Vector to store individual words
    string word, longestWord;  // Variables to store the current word and the longest word
    int maxLength = 0;         // Variable to track the maximum length of a word

    while (ss >> word) {       // Split sentence by space and add each word to the vector
        words.push_back(word);
    }

    // Loop through each word and find the longest one
    for (const string& w : words) {
        if (w.length() > maxLength) {
            maxLength = w.length(); 
            longestWord = w;      // Update longestWord if a longer word is found
        }
    }
    
    return longestWord;         // Return the longest word
}

int main() {
    string input = "I love programming in JavaScript";
    string result = findLongestWordBruteForce(input); // Find longest word
    cout << "The longest word is: " << result << endl; // Output the result
    return 0;
}
```

#### **Explanation of Time and Space Complexity:**
- **Time Complexity:** \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the total number of characters in the sentence. The code iterates over each character to split the sentence into words and then compares each word's length.
- **Space Complexity:** \(O(m)\), where \(m\) is the number of words in the sentence. We store each word in a vector, and the space used depends on the number of words.

---

### **Approach 2: Easy Approach**

This approach eliminates the need to store all the words in a vector. Instead, we iterate over the sentence and compare the lengths of words directly. We will update the longest word on the fly.

#### **Code (Easy Approach):**

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <sstream>
#include <string>
using namespace std;

string findLongestWordEasy(const string& sentence) {
    stringstream ss(sentence);  // Create a stringstream to split the sentence
    string word, longestWord;   // Variables to store the current word and the longest word
    int maxLength = 0;          // Variable to track the maximum word length

    while (ss >> word) {        // Split the sentence into words
        if (word.length() > maxLength) { // Compare current word's length with maxLength
            maxLength = word.length();  // Update maxLength if current word is longer
            longestWord = word;        // Update longestWord with the current word
        }
    }
    
    return longestWord; // Return the longest word
}

int main() {
    string input = "I love programming in JavaScript";
    string result = findLongestWordEasy(input);  // Find longest word
    cout << "The longest word is: " << result << endl; // Output the result
    return 0;
}
```

#### **Explanation of Time and Space Complexity:**
- **Time Complexity:** \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the total number of characters in the sentence. We split the sentence and compare each word's length during one pass.
- **Space Complexity:** \(O(1)\), since we only use a few variables to store the longest word and the current word, and do not store the entire sentence or words.

### **Approach 3: Moderate Approach (Handling Edge Cases)**

This approach builds on the previous one, but it includes checks for edge cases, such as when the input string is empty. If the string is empty, we return an empty string as the result.

#### **Code (Moderate Approach with Edge Case Handling):**

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <sstream>
#include <string>
using namespace std;

string findLongestWordModerate(const string& sentence) {
    if (sentence.empty()) return "";  // Edge case: If the sentence is empty, return an empty string
    
    stringstream ss(sentence);  // Split the sentence
    string word, longestWord;  // Variables to store current word and the longest word
    int maxLength = 0;         // Variable to track the maximum length of a word

    while (ss >> word) {       // Split sentence into words
        if (word.length() > maxLength) {  // Compare each word's length with maxLength
            maxLength = word.length();   // Update maxLength if current word is longer
            longestWord = word;          // Update longestWord with the current word
        }
    }
    
    return longestWord;   // Return the longest word
}

int main() {
    string input = "I love programming in JavaScript";
    string result = findLongestWordModerate(input);  // Find the longest word
    cout << "The longest word is: " << result << endl; // Output the result
    return 0;
}
```

#### **Explanation of Time and Space Complexity:**
- **Time Complexity:** \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the total number of characters in the sentence. We iterate through the sentence and compare each wordâ€™s length.
- **Space Complexity:** \(O(1)\), no extra space is used except for variables to store the longest word and the current word.

#### **Edge Cases Handled:**
- Empty sentence: Returns an empty string.
- Single-word sentence: Returns the word itself.
- Sentences with multiple spaces: Works correctly because `stringstream` handles multiple spaces.

### **Approach 4: Optimal Approach (Single Loop)**

This is the most efficient approach. Instead of splitting the sentence into words, we iterate through the characters of the sentence directly and build words as we go. Whenever we encounter a space, we check if the current word is the longest.

#### **Code (Optimal Approach):**

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
using namespace std;

string findLongestWordOptimal(const string& sentence) {
    string longestWord, currentWord; // Variables to store the longest word and current word

    for (char c : sentence) {      // Loop through each character in the sentence
        if (c == ' ') {             // Space indicates the end of a word
            if (currentWord.length() > longestWord.length()) { // Compare word length
                longestWord = currentWord;  // Update longestWord if current is longer
            }
            currentWord.clear();  // Reset current word for the next word
        } else {
            currentWord += c;     // Add character to the current word
        }
    }
    
    // Final check for the last word (if sentence doesn't end with a space)
    if (currentWord.length() > longestWord.length()) {
        longestWord = currentWord;  // Update longest word if the last word is the longest
    }
    
    return longestWord;  // Return the longest word
}

int main() {
    string input = "I love programming in JavaScript";
    string result = findLongestWordOptimal(input);  // Find the longest word
    cout << "The longest word is: " << result << endl; // Output the result
    return 0;
}
```

#### **Explanation of Time and Space Complexity:**
- **Time Complexity:** \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the total number of characters in the sentence. This approach processes each character in the sentence once.
- **Space Complexity:** \(O(1)\), only a few variables (`longestWord`, `currentWord`) are used to track the result, regardless of the sentence length.

#### **Key Benefits:**
- No extra space is used for storing words, making this the most space-efficient solution.
- Only one pass over the string is needed, ensuring minimal overhead.
