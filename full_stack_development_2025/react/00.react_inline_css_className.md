# **Transitioning to React: Inline Styles and `className` Explained**

React introduces several changes to how you handle styling and class names compared to plain HTML and CSS. If you already know HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this guide will show you how these concepts evolve in React and why these changes exist. By the end, you'll be confident in using these features without needing any additional resource.

## **Part 1: Inline Styles in React vs. HTML**

### **What Are Inline Styles?**

In both HTML and React, inline styles allow you to apply CSS directly to an element without using a separate stylesheet. However, the way you write and manage inline styles in React differs significantly from traditional HTML.

---

### **Inline Styles in HTML**

In HTML, you apply styles using the `style` attribute. The attribute takes a string containing CSS rules. These rules follow the same syntax as CSS:

```html
<div style="color: red; font-size: 16px;">Hello, World!</div>
```

Here:

- **`color`** sets the text color to red.
- **`font-size`** sets the font size to 16 pixels.

This is straightforward and familiar if you know CSS, but it has limitations:

1. Strings can't dynamically calculate styles or interact with JavaScript logic.
2. Long styles become messy and difficult to read or maintain.

---

### **Inline Styles in React**

In React, the `style` attribute is not a string but a **JavaScript object**. This change gives React more flexibility and integration with JavaScript. Here’s how it looks:

```jsx
function Greeting() {
  return <div style={{ color: "red", fontSize: 16 }}>Hello, World!</div>;
}
```

#### Key Points to Note:

1. **Object Format**: The value of the `style` attribute is an object, represented with `{}`.
2. **CamelCase Properties**: Instead of kebab-case (`font-size`), React uses camelCase (`fontSize`) for CSS property names.
3. **String and Numeric Values**: CSS values can be strings (e.g., `"red"`) or numbers (e.g., `16` for `16px`). React assumes `px` for numeric values unless specified otherwise.

---

### **Practical Example**

Let’s style a button in both HTML and React to see the difference:

#### In HTML:

```html
<button
  style="background-color: blue; color: white; padding: 10px; border-radius: 5px;"
>
  Click Me
</button>
```

#### In React:

```jsx
function StyledButton() {
  return (
    <button
      style={{
        backgroundColor: "blue",
        color: "white",
        padding: 10,
        borderRadius: 5,
      }}
    >
      Click Me
    </button>
  );
}
```

---

### **Dynamic Inline Styles in React**

One of the biggest advantages of React’s inline styles is the ability to dynamically calculate styles based on component state or props.

For example:

```jsx
function DynamicButton({ isActive }) {
  const buttonStyle = {
    backgroundColor: isActive ? "green" : "gray",
    color: "white",
    padding: "10px 20px",
    borderRadius: "5px",
    cursor: isActive ? "pointer" : "not-allowed",
  };

  return (
    <button style={buttonStyle}>{isActive ? "Active" : "Inactive"}</button>
  );
}
```

Here:

- The `backgroundColor` and `cursor` change dynamically based on the `isActive` prop.
- This level of interactivity is hard to achieve with plain HTML.

### **Comparison Table: Inline Styles in HTML vs. React**

| Feature         | HTML                             | React                        |
| --------------- | -------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Syntax          | `style="key: value;"`            | `style={{ key: "value" }}`   |
| Property Names  | Kebab-case (e.g., `font-size`)   | CamelCase (e.g., `fontSize`) |
| Values          | Strings only                     | Strings or numbers           |
| Dynamic Styling | Requires JavaScript manipulation | Directly supported           |

## **Part 2: From `class` to `className` in React**

### **Why the Change?**

In plain HTML, the `class` attribute is used to assign CSS classes. However, in React, `class` is replaced with `className`. This is because `class` is a reserved keyword in JavaScript. Using `class` in JSX would conflict with the keyword, so React uses `className` instead.

---

### **Using `class` in HTML**

Here’s an example of how CSS classes are applied in plain HTML:

```html
<div class="container">This is a container.</div>
```

The `class` attribute associates the element with a CSS class in your stylesheet.

---

### **Using `className` in React**

In React, the equivalent syntax uses `className`:

```jsx
function App() {
  return <div className="container">This is a container.</div>;
}
```

This change is small but essential for writing JSX correctly.

---

### **Dynamic Class Assignment in React**

React allows you to assign classes dynamically, combining static and conditional classes seamlessly. For example:

```jsx
function DynamicClass({ isActive }) {
  const className = isActive ? "active" : "inactive";
  return <div className={className}>Dynamic Class Example</div>;
}
```

This approach avoids string concatenation often used in plain JavaScript for similar functionality.

---

### **Combining Multiple Classes**

React supports multiple classes using string concatenation or libraries like `classnames`:

#### Using Template Literals:

```jsx
function MultipleClasses({ isPrimary, isDisabled }) {
  const className = `${isPrimary ? "primary" : ""} ${
    isDisabled ? "disabled" : ""
  }`;
  return <button className={className}>Submit</button>;
}
```

#### Using `classnames` (Popular Library):

```jsx
import classNames from "classnames";

function MultipleClasses({ isPrimary, isDisabled }) {
  const className = classNames({
    primary: isPrimary,
    disabled: isDisabled,
  });

  return <button className={className}>Submit</button>;
}
```

### **Comparison Table: `class` vs. `className`**

| Feature                | HTML                             | React JSX                                  |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Attribute Name         | `class`                          | `className`                                |
| Dynamic Assignment     | Requires JavaScript manipulation | Supported directly with expressions        |
| Reserved Keyword Issue | Not Applicable                   | Avoids conflict with `class` in JavaScript |

---

## **Best Practices**

1. **Use Styles Sparingly**: Inline styles in React are useful for dynamic or component-specific styles, but for larger applications, prefer external CSS or CSS-in-JS solutions like styled-components or Emotion.
2. **Leverage `className` for Reusability**: Use CSS classes for shared styles across components and rely on dynamic class assignment for flexibility.
3. **Keep Styles Organized**: Break down complex styling logic into reusable helper functions or constants.

---

### **Conclusion**

React introduces subtle but impactful changes in how you manage styles and class names. While these differences may seem minor at first, they provide powerful ways to make your components dynamic, interactive, and maintainable. Understanding these changes and practicing them will help you transition smoothly into React development.
