# Detailed Explanation of Asynchronous Programming in React

In the provided code, three different approaches to handling asynchronous code in React are demonstrated: **async/await**, **Promises**, and **Callbacks**. To fully understand how asynchronous code works in JavaScript, it's important to first explore the underlying concepts, how the event loop works, and the order in which things are executed in the call stack. 

This detailed breakdown will explain everything step by step, starting from the basics and progressing through each approach used in the code.

### The Event Loop

Before diving into the specific examples, let's cover the **event loop** concept in JavaScript. Understanding the event loop is critical because it explains how asynchronous code runs and when things get executed.

**What is the Event Loop?**

JavaScript is single-threaded, which means it can only execute one operation at a time. To handle multiple asynchronous tasks (like fetching data from an API), JavaScript uses the **event loop**. The event loop is responsible for executing tasks in a non-blocking way by managing the **call stack** and the **callback queue**.

1. **Call Stack**: This is where functions are executed. When a function is called, it's pushed onto the stack. When the function finishes, it's popped off the stack.

2. **Callback Queue**: When asynchronous operations (like a fetch request or setTimeout) are initiated, the callback (the function that should be executed after the async task) is placed in the callback queue. The event loop will check the call stack. If the call stack is empty, it will move the callback from the callback queue to the call stack for execution.

3. **Microtask Queue**: This is a special queue for tasks that need to be executed as soon as the call stack is empty, before any I/O events. Promises are added to the **microtask queue**, which means they will be executed after the current script finishes but before anything else from the event loop (like setTimeout).

4. **Event Loop**: The event loop continuously checks if the call stack is empty. If it is, it pushes any pending tasks from the callback or microtask queue onto the stack.

### 1. **Async/Await**

In the **async/await** approach, asynchronous code is written in a way that looks synchronous. The `await` keyword is used to wait for the promise to resolve before continuing the execution of code. It allows you to write asynchronous code in a more readable, linear way.

#### **How async/await works:**

1. **Async Functions**: When a function is declared with the `async` keyword, it automatically returns a promise. The `async` function can use the `await` keyword inside it to pause execution until a promise is resolved.
   
2. **Await**: The `await` keyword is used to pause the execution of the code until the promise passed to it is resolved (or rejected). It only works inside async functions.

Here’s the breakdown of how the `async/await` code executes in your component:

```js
const fetchAllData = async () => {
  setLoading(true); // Sets the loading state to true
  setError(null); // Resets any previous error

  try {
    // Fetch state data
    const stateResponse = await fetch("https://bank-apis.justinclicks.com/API/V1/STATE/");
    const stateJson = await stateResponse.json();
    setStateData(stateJson);

    // Fetch city data for Maharashtra
    const cityResponse = await fetch("https://bank-apis.justinclicks.com/API/V1/STATE/MAHARASHTRA/");
    const cityJson = await cityResponse.json();
    setCityData(cityJson);

    // Fetch area data for Pune
    const areaResponse = await fetch("https://bank-apis.justinclicks.com/API/V1/STATE/MAHARASHTRA/PUNE/");
    const areaJson = await areaResponse.json();
    setAreaData(areaJson);

    // Fetch sub-area data for Khutbao
    const subAreaResponse = await fetch("https://bank-apis.justinclicks.com/API/V1/STATE/MAHARASHTRA/PUNE/KHUTBAO/");
    const subAreaJson = await subAreaResponse.json();
    setSubAreaData(subAreaJson);

    // Fetch final JSON data
    const finalResponse = await fetch("https://bank-apis.justinclicks.com/API/V1/STATE/MAHARASHTRA/PUNE/KHUTBAO/KHUTBAO/KHUTBHAV.json");
    const finalJson = await finalResponse.json();
    setFinalData(finalJson);

  } catch (err) {
    setError("An error occurred while fetching data.");
  } finally {
    setLoading(false); // Sets loading to false when the fetching is complete
  }
};
```

#### **Execution Flow:**

- The execution of this code starts immediately when the `fetchAllData` function is invoked.
- The first line (`setLoading(true)`) sets the loading state to true, and the `setError(null)` clears any previous error.
- The code then reaches the first `await` keyword:
  - `await fetch(...)` pauses the function execution until the API request is complete and returns a response.
  - Once the response is received, it proceeds to the next line, converting the response to JSON and updating the state.
- The `await` ensures that each API call happens sequentially, i.e., the next API request is not sent until the current one is completed.
- If any error occurs, the `catch` block will handle it and set an error message.
- After all the fetches are done, `setLoading(false)` is called to mark the process as complete.

#### **What Happens Under the Hood?**

- **Call Stack**: Initially, the code enters the call stack when `fetchAllData` is called.
- **Event Loop**: When the `await` keyword is encountered, JavaScript suspends the execution of the function and moves it out of the call stack, freeing up the stack to do other things.
- **Microtask Queue**: The `fetch` call returns a promise, which is placed in the microtask queue once it's resolved. The `await` will only proceed when the promise is resolved, and the data is retrieved.
- **Call Stack**: After the promise is resolved, the rest of the function will continue executing. Once the `fetchAllData` function finishes, it is removed from the call stack.

This allows you to handle asynchronous code in a way that looks and behaves synchronously, while still being non-blocking.

### 2. **Promises**

Promises represent the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation. They allow you to chain operations after the asynchronous task completes. Promises are designed to handle asynchronous code in a more manageable way than callbacks.

#### **How Promises work:**

1. A Promise has three states:
   - **Pending**: The operation is still ongoing.
   - **Resolved**: The operation completed successfully.
   - **Rejected**: The operation failed.

2. You use `.then()` to handle resolved values and `.catch()` to handle rejections.

Here’s the breakdown of how Promises are handled in your component:

```js
const fetchWithPromises = () => {
  setLoading(true); // Sets the loading state to true
  setError(null); // Resets any previous error

  fetch("https://bank-apis.justinclicks.com/API/V1/STATE/")
    .then((response) => response.json()) // Handles the response and converts it to JSON
    .then((data) => {
      setStateData(data); // Sets the state with the fetched data
      return fetch("https://bank-apis.justinclicks.com/API/V1/STATE/MAHARASHTRA/"); // Fetches the next API
    })
    .then((response) => response.json()) // Handles the next response
    .then((data) => {
      setCityData(data); // Sets the city data
      return fetch("https://bank-apis.justinclicks.com/API/V1/STATE/MAHARASHTRA/PUNE/"); // Fetches the next API
    })
    .then((response) => response.json())
    .then((data) => {
      setAreaData(data); // Sets the area data
      return fetch("https://bank-apis.justinclicks.com/API/V1/STATE/MAHARASHTRA/PUNE/KHUTBAO/"); // Fetches sub-area data
    })
    .then((response) => response.json())
    .then((data) => {
      setSubAreaData(data); // Sets sub-area data
      return fetch("https://bank-apis.justinclicks.com/API/V1/STATE/MAHARASHTRA/PUNE/KHUTBAO/KHUTBAO/KHUTBHAV.json"); // Fetches the final data
    })
    .then((response) => response.json())
    .then((data) => {
      setFinalData(data); // Sets the final data
    })
    .catch((err) => {
      setError("An error occurred while fetching data.");
    })
    .finally(() => {
      setLoading(false); // Marks the fetching process as complete
    });
};
```

#### **Execution Flow:**

- The first fetch call begins immediately when the `fetchWithPromises` function is invoked.
- Each `.then()` waits for the previous promise to resolve before executing the next `.then()`.
- The function returns the next fetch call, which is chained to the previous one.
- After each `.then()` resolves, it moves to the next one, in sequence, ensuring that each fetch is done one by one.
-

 If any promise is rejected, the `.catch()` block handles the error.
- Once all promises are resolved or rejected, `finally()` is called to set the loading state to false.

### 3. **Callbacks**

Callbacks are the traditional way of handling asynchronous operations. You pass a function as an argument to another function, and that function is called when the asynchronous operation completes.

#### **How Callbacks work:**

1. **Callback Function**: A function passed as an argument to another function to be executed once the task is completed.
2. The callback is executed after the asynchronous operation finishes.

Here’s how the callback approach is used:

```js
const fetchWithCallbacks = () => {
  setLoading(true); // Sets loading state to true
  setError(null); // Clears any previous errors

  fetch("https://bank-apis.justinclicks.com/API/V1/STATE/", (err, stateData) => {
    if (err) {
      setError("Error fetching state data");
      return;
    }
    setStateData(stateData);

    fetch("https://bank-apis.justinclicks.com/API/V1/STATE/MAHARASHTRA/", (err, cityData) => {
      if (err) {
        setError("Error fetching city data");
        return;
      }
      setCityData(cityData);

      fetch("https://bank-apis.justinclicks.com/API/V1/STATE/MAHARASHTRA/PUNE/", (err, areaData) => {
        if (err) {
          setError("Error fetching area data");
          return;
        }
        setAreaData(areaData);

        fetch("https://bank-apis.justinclicks.com/API/V1/STATE/MAHARASHTRA/PUNE/KHUTBAO/", (err, subAreaData) => {
          if (err) {
            setError("Error fetching sub-area data");
            return;
          }
          setSubAreaData(subAreaData);

          fetch("https://bank-apis.justinclicks.com/API/V1/STATE/MAHARASHTRA/PUNE/KHUTBAO/KHUTBAO/KHUTBHAV.json", (err, finalData) => {
            if (err) {
              setError("Error fetching final data");
              return;
            }
            setFinalData(finalData);
            setLoading(false);
          });
        });
      });
    });
  });
};
```

#### **Execution Flow:**

- A callback is passed to each `fetch()` call. Once the data is received, the corresponding callback is executed.
- If any callback detects an error (if `err` is truthy), the error is set in the state.
- The callbacks are executed in sequence, one after another, ensuring that the subsequent API call is made only when the previous one is complete.
- Finally, the loading state is set to false after all fetches are done.
